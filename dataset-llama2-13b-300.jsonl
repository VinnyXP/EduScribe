It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe main camping area from the ferris wheel at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tenn., on Thursday, June 7, 2018. (Photo: Shelley Mays / Tennessean.com) \n \n MANCHESTER, Tenn. - A Bonnaroo attendee was found dead Friday morning on the venue's grounds marking the 13th death at the music and arts festival in its 17-year history, officials said. \n \n The Coffee County Sheriff's Office identified the man as Michael Donivan Craddock, Jr., 32 of Mount Juliet, Tenn. \n \n Sheriff's office spokesman Lucky Knott said about 10:30 a.m., the sheriff's office responded to the festival's campground for a medical call. When deputies and investigators arrived at the scene, they found Craddock dead inside a vehicle. \n \n Sheriff Steve Graves said foul play is not suspected in the death. \n \n Graves said Craddock’s body has been sent to the medical examiner office in Nashville, for an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death. \n \n His death is the only known fatality so far at the festival, authorities said. \n \n Bonnaroo 2018 started Thursday and is scheduled to run through Sunday. Festival headliners include Eminem, the Killers, and Muse. \n \n Bonnaroo 2018 day 1: Here's what we saw in the fest’s first hours \n \n So far this year, Knott said dozens of people have been either treated or transported by ambulance to local hospitals to be treated for heat-related issues at the festival. \n \n First responders reminded festival attendees to hydrate and wear hats if possible. \n \n \"The temperature is 90 with a heat index of 99,\" Knott said Friday afternoon. \"We can't stress it enough that concert goers to drink a lot of water. Staying hydrated will save your life.\" \n \n Although he did not give an exact number, Bonnaroo medical director Carl Monzo said transports are \"lower than the same time last year.\" \n \n A high of 94 topped Manchester on Friday and highs in the upper 80s and low 90s are expected during the next three days of the festival. \n \n More: Bonnaroo will now wash your clothes - for free \n \n The last death at Bonnaroo took place in June 2015 after a 47-year-old man died after collapsing in the event's main area — known as Centeroo. His death stemmed from a pre-existing cardiac issue, authorities at the time said. \n \n A year later, on June 11, 2016, festival attendee Casey J. Young, 22, of Louisville, was struck and killed by multiple vehicles outside the festival grounds on Interstate 24. \n \n According to a Davidson County autopsy report, his manner of death was accidental and his cause of death was from multiple blunt force injuries. No drugs or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death, a toxicology report found. \n \n Arrests, citations and fire calls \n \n Law enforcement overseeing Bonnaroo have cited about 60 people and arrested about 19 people, records as of late afternoon Friday showed. \n \n A majority were for public intoxication, disorderly conduct and illegal possession of a controlled substance, Knott said. \n \n Bonnaroo fire authorities said no major fire calls had been reported. \n \n Glen Aussicker, a firefighter shift leader, said most of the calls stemmed from carbon monoxide alarms triggering in RVs so far this week. Most of the alarms sounded off during the evening hours, he said. \n \n If an RV alarm sounds, firefighters say residents should immediately open all windows to allow the poisonous air to escape, leave the camper and dial 911. \n \n They are also reminding campers carbon monoxide doesn't just affect people inside RVs. \n \n Firefighters are asking festival attendees to remember not to pitch tents next to an RV's exhausts or even car exhausts — especially if someone is in the car cooling off with the AC or charging their phone. \n \n Another safety tip: Crack RV windows when no one is inside. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2sNt9CQ\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA person has died while attending the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Tennessee, reports the AP.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nforce measurements on a scaled hair - bundle model respected the physiological character of the liquid flow . \n the finite - element method provided approximate solutions to partial differential equations reflecting the hair bundle 's geometry . \n the velocity variable of the liquid was substituted by the time derivative of the displacement ; fluid pressure was approximated by linear shape functions and the displacements of liquid and solid by quadratic ones . \n the hydrodynamic forces between stereocilia were estimated analytically by solving the stefan - reynolds equations under the lubrication approximation, which is valid when the gaps between adjacent stereocilia are much smaller than their diameter . \n stochastic simulations based on these results were performed for a system of linearly coupled dynamic variables following a langevin description with gaussian white noise at room temperature . \n the integration procedure was validated by choosing time steps small enough to assure that the results were independent of the increment . \n we tested the effects of inertia and of the estimated top - connecter stiffness and confirmed the validity of our conclusions for mammalian hair bundles . \n dual - beam differential interferometry was used to record stereociliary motions with sub - nanometre spatial and sub - millisecond temporal resolution . \n fourier analysis of the records was performed with the multitaper method to obtain coherence spectra as well as stiffness and drag coefficients . \n these results were used to verify the predictions of the numerical model and to measure directly the relative mode of motion between stereocilia .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe detection of sound begins when energy derived from an acoustic stimulus deflects the hair bundles atop hair cells1 . \n as hair bundles move, the viscous friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental physical challenge to the earfs high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity . \n part of the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for frequency - selective sound amplification2,3 . here \n we demonstrate that a complementary part of the solution involves the fluid - structure interaction between stereocilia and the liquid within the hair bundle . using force measurement on a dynamically scaled model, finite - element analysis, analytical estimation of hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation, and high - resolution interferometric measurement of hair bundles \n, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the forces between individual stereocilia during small hair - bundle deflections . \n we find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion . \n the obliquely oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least dissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors that stabilize the structure further reduce the drag . \n as measured from the distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of viscous and elastic forces in a hair bundle permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses only a fraction of a nanometre . \n a combination of high - resolution experiments and detailed numerical modelling of fluid - structure interactions reveals the physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive mechanotransduction .\n#END SUMMARY"}

Indeed, the first half of the show frequently returned to the many sexual misconduct scandals roiling powerful men and the institutions that once protected them — including Senator Al Franken, the “S.N.L.” alumnus who said on Thursday that he would resign his seat as he faced allegations from at least six women of groping and improper advances. \n \n The show’s pointed and effective opening sketch, which featured Kenan Thompson as the would-be Santa and Kate McKinnon as his elfin assistant, began with a boy asking Mr. Thompson for traditional gifts like Mega Bloks and Lazer Tag. \n \n “And,” the boy added, “can you tell me, what did Al Franken do?” \n \n Mr. Thompson was understandably taken aback. “O.K., wow, let’s see,” he said. “I think I can handle the Mega Bloks and the Lazer Tag. Can you take the Al Franken thing, Sugarplum?” ||||| UPDATE, with video No political impressions or surprise guests to kick off tonight’s Saturday Night Live cold open – instead, the NBC comedy went with a Christmas bit that had a bunch of wised-up kids asking Kenan Thompson’s shopping mall Santa questions like, “Can you tell me, what did Al Franken do?” \n \n Asked the little boy in a reindeer sweater, “And what kinda list is Roy Moore on?” \n \n “It’s more of a registry,” replied Kate McKinnon’s helpful elf, asking Santa to refrain from calling her Sugar Plum “in this climate.” (Take a look at a couple brief clips below.) \n \n Asked another little boy, why do all those football players kneel – do they hate the troops or are they just tired from all the brain injuries? Then a little girl complained about feminazis taking away her Barbie, and another stumbling over the words “embassy” and “Tel Aviv.” (Another little girl missed her set-up entirely, leaving Thompson – who may or may not have been to blame – to land a Chuck Schumer punchline as a non sequitur. NOTE: As a Deadline commenter noticed, the clip above must be of the dress rehearsal. It’s mistake-free). \n \n And there was the inevitable inside-NBC joke when Santa asked a boy what kind of toy he wanted for Christmas. “You mean like the one Matt Lauer gave to his co-worker?” the kid asked. \n \n Finally, a little girl named Jenny said all she wanted for Christmas was for everything to be okay. Consoled not-Sugar Plum the elf, all will be fine – in “three years, 42 days and 24 minutes.” \n \n Tonight’s episode is hosted by James Franco, with musical guest SZA.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIt's that time of the year to determine who's been naughty and who's been nice, and Saturday Night Live jumped in with its two cents on the seemingly endless sexual harassment scandals in its Cold Open. With Kenan Thompson as Santa and Kate McKinnon as an elf, a line of children asked things like, \"Can you tell me, what did Al Franken do?\" Per the New York Times, Thompson replies that he's got that particular boy's toy requests, but says to McKinnon, \"Can you take the Al Franken thing, sugarplum?\" McKinnon refuses, adding, \"in this climate, can you just call me Amy?\" When the boy's line of questioning turns to Roy Moore, McKinnon says he's not so much on Santa's naughty \"list. It's more of a registry,\" adds Deadline. Others taking a hit included President Trump (\"Nineteen accusers. Google it,\" says McKinnon) and Matt Lauer (one boy asked if he wanted a toy responded, \"Oh, you mean toy like the one Matt Lauer gave to his co-worker?\" The episode was guest-hosted by James Franco.\n#END SUMMARY"}

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo \n \n (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision was “Worth It”. \n \n The tweet, sent late Friday evening less than an hour before Musk tweeted that he would take a break from Twitter “for a few days,” was in response to a question from a Twitter follower. \n \n The SEC in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed. \n \n Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement. \n \n Under the settlement agreement, Tesla needs to appoint an independent chairman by Nov. 13. ||||| Photo: Chris Carlson (AP) \n \n It’s arguably unfathomable that any human being slapped with a $20 million fine for a bad tweet would ever consider returning to the platform, much less continue to fire off word salad at all hours of the day and night. In the face of any logical explanation, however, one such man seemingly continues to insist that he is not owned. \n \n \n \n Tweeting Friday evening in a thread about “criticism” and “like” ratios on Twitter’s platform, Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared to claim that his disastrous “420” tweet in August about taking the electric car company private was “worth” the tens of millions of dollars in fines regulators levied on him in response. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Why? The likes. \n \n Earlier this month, a judge officially approved Tesla’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it argued that Musk made “false and misleading” statements in regards to going private. In the settlement, Musk and Tesla agreed to each pay a fine of $20 million, with Musk also forced to step down as Tesla’s chairman for at least three years. Tesla was also required to rein in Musk’s communications with investors. \n \n Advertisement \n \n This was a mere weeks ago. \n \n Remarkably, Musk later tweeted that he was going to sign “off Twitter for a few days,” which honestly doesn’t seem like such a bad long-term plan either.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nSage Stallone White Powder Found In Bedroom \n \n White Powder Found In Sage Stallone's Bedroom \n \n Exclusive Details \n \n Authorities found baggies of white powder in the room wheredied ...

He is the fiancé of Princess Mako, the eldest grandchild of Japan’s Emperor Akihito, head of the world’s oldest monarchy. \n \n Or is he? \n \n On Thursday, in response to a request by Japan’s Imperial Household Agency, which oversees the ceremonial functions and protocols of the royal family, Fordham removed a phrase from a news release that had trumpeted Mr. Komuro, a paralegal in Tokyo, as the “fiancé of Princess Mako of Japan.” \n \n As demonstrated by the recent wedding of Prince Harry of Britain and Meghan Markle, a biracial, divorced American, any commoner who marries into a royal family is subjected to intense scrutiny. ||||| Kei Komuro, a paralegal at the Okuno & Partners law firm in Japan who is engaged to be married to Japan’s Princess Mako, will attend Fordham Law School starting in August. He has received the Michael M. Martin Scholarship. The Martin Scholarship is a merit scholarship covering the full cost of tuition from Fordham Law based on his strong academic and other credentials. The Martin Scholarship is not a loan and does not need to be repaid. He will enter the law school’s one-year LL.M. program and then hopes to continue for two more years to receive a J.D. \n \n The law school’s LL.M. program is structured on two interdependent principles: globalization and specialization. The eight LL.M. degrees offer the opportunity to specialize in fields that are evolving as the law, economy, technology, and times demand. This spring, 181 students were enrolled in the LL.M. program, six of them from Japan. More information about the LL.M. program is here.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nOne word in a press release put out by Fordham University Law School in New York has attracted international attention—attention strong enough to get Fordham to tweak the release. The egregious word? \"Fiancé.\" It was written in reference to Kei Komuro, who is set to begin studying for his master's degree in law on a full scholarship next month. He's also engaged to marry Japan's Princess Mako. The press release identified him as her \"fiancé,\" and the word choice apparently rankled Japan's Imperial Household Agency, which handles royal protocol. The New York Times reports a rep for the agency told reporters Komuro \"does not have the status of being engaged and therefore is not a fiancé.\" The university explained the removal (you can see the updated release here) was done \"out of respect\" for the agency's protocol and traditions, one of which is the Nosai no Gi—a royal engagement ceremony that was supposed to occur on March 4. It was postponed after the agency in February announced the 26-year-olds' wedding wouldn't occur in November as planned, with the Japan Times reporting at the time that a \"lack of preparation\" and \"immaturity\" were cited as the reasons for the delay to 2020, though tabloids have speculated that alleged financial troubles on the part of Komuro's mother played a part. The Japan Times used the word \"fiancé\" in its own report on Komuro's university plans, noting that after the one-year program, he hopes to continue for two more years in order to secure a degree that would allow him to practice law in the US. (Mako will lose her royal status after the wedding.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Eck told the news site that he changed the manner of death back to homicide after being urged to re-examine the case by Katzenmoyer's mother, Ginger Katzenmoyer, of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. \n \n The officers named in the suit as Katzenmoyer's assailants are former Camden City police officers John McArdle and Ronald Lattanzio. Philly.com reported that they were never disciplined and they do not work for the county force that now polices the city. \n \n In the civil case, the city refuted claims that the officers used excessive force or contributed to Katzenmoyer's death. \n \n Philly.com reported he was arrested after police received a report he had hit a woman he did not know on the chest. \n \n The site reported he refused to be cuffed and was taken to the ground during his arrest. A friend of his who was also taken into custody reported seeing multiple officers hit him in the head with batons. \n \n He was taken to Virtua hospital in Camden, where police say he tried to grab McArdle's gun while he was strapped down to a board -- something the security guard testified never happened, according to Philly.com. \n \n The guard reportedly said he saw McArdle punch Katzenmoyer in the face multiple times as Katzenmoyer screamed and threatened to sue them. He was also pepper sprayed, according to the lawsuit. \n \n He was transferred to a different hospital and released the next day with percocet for the pain from his injuries. \n \n He went to a Pennsylvania hospital the following day, suffering from headaches, facial tremors and blood leaking from his ears, according to the suit. A CT scan found nothing wrong. \n \n His mother found him unresponsive Aug. 22, and he was given Narcan in the ambulance. Emergency responders and hospital staff resuscitated him multiple times but he died the following day. The lawsuit says he died from cardiac issues but also had signs of renal failure and oxygen deprivation in his brain. \n \n Ginger Katzenmoyer told Philly.com she plans to ask the Camden County prosecutor's office to reopen the investigation into the actions that caused her son's death, according to the new ruling from the coroner. \n \n The prosecutor's office told the news site it has not received any new information from the coroner and so it can't comment on what will happen with the case. \n \n Rebecca Everett may be reached at reverett@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @rebeccajeverett. Find NJ.com on Facebook.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nTen years after Brett Katzenmoyer died following a \"violent struggle\" with New Jersey police, a county coroner has classified the 20-year-old's death as a homicide, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Katzenmoyer was drinking beer with friends outside an OAR concert in 2007 in Camden when a woman told police officers Katzenmoyer hit her in the chest. In a police report, officers Ronald Lattanzio and John McArdle say Katzenmoyer refused to put his hands behind his back and swung at them. After subduing Katzenmoyer, the officers took him to a hospital. A hospital security guard says Katzenmoyer was threatening to sue the officers, and McArdle hit him repeatedly in the face to \"shut him up.\" The guard says McArdle also “beat [Katzenmoyer] in the face, from the nose to the eye\" while the 20-year-old was restrained. Katzenmoyer suffered a concussion, broken nose, and more, NJ.com reports. He was sent home from the hospital but died days later from heart and renal failure. The coroner at the time ruled a cause of death \"could not be determined\" because Katzenmoyer had morphine and sleeping pills in his system. His family has been fighting that ruling for years, getting the new county coroner, Gordon Eck, to re-examine the case. On Thursday, Eck changed the cause of death to \"homicide.\" Katzenmoyer's mother says she's \"just grateful that someone finally ... did the right thing.\" She plans to ask the prosecutor's office to reopen the investigation. Katzenmoyer's family received a $750,000 settlement from the city in 2013, but the officers were never disciplined.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Stay for the sexy fantasy chicks!\" That's the way TMZ plugs a bizarre video trying to sell what's being touted as Beverly Hills' most expensive home: a $100 million retreat called Opus, the brainchild of film producer Nile Niami, per People. The 20,500-square-foot residence features seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, and a list of other extravagant amenities that People notes \"a luxury buyer ... couldn't have dreamed up if they tried.\" Those add-ons include a champagne vault that can hold 170 bottles of Cristal champagne (there's a 944-bottle overflow area if that's not enough room); a 10-car \"museum\" that comes already stocked with a Rolls and a Lamborghini that, combined, could be worth close to $800,000 themselves; and more plebeian comforts like a couple of swimming pools, a wellness center, and a salon. But it's the hedonistic, NSFW video that real estate firm Hilton & Hyland is using to promote the fancy digs that's really catching everyone's attention. The three-minute commercial is designed to show hopeful homeowners \"a sneak peek into a life where the boundaries are limitless,\" which in Beverly Hills seems to include writhing, nearly naked gold-coated women enjoying their time in the house with a pretend female homeowner, with the spectacular Los Angeles landscape in full view. To say there are sexual undertones is an understatement—especially when the homeowner breaks open one of those Cristal bottles. \"I kept telling the director 'Go darker … go sexier …' and was thrilled to see the results,\" Niami says, per People. (There's another home in LA that's serious competition.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAs the election has drawn closer, Donald Trump's voice on Twitter has gotten louder. And progressively more insane. \n \n Finally, he's getting called for his nonsense. \n \n On NBC, Brian Williams said, Trump has \"driven well past the last exit to relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible.\" \n \n Williams also read some of Trump's dopey tweets on the air, then said, \"So, that happened.\" \n \n It is an extra interesting comment from Williams because Trump is a star for NBC with \"The Apprentice.\" It's rare for two big network personalities to clash. \n \n But, the truth of the matter is that Trump has been a clown for this entire election cycle. Someone had to point it out. ||||| [There was a video here] \n \n Diane Sawyer was definitely probably drunk tonight during ABC's election coverage. Would you agree? Not convinced yet? She slurred every other word, rambled about the lack of music, and asked a correspondent if the exclamation point in the Obama slogan represented the direction he truly wanted to go with his presidency. What more proof do you need? \n \n But of course it was already true according to Twitter: \n \n nothig to c here guys im ok d'ont worry abot me — Drunk Diane Sawyer (@DrnkDianeSawyer) November 7, 2012 \n \n And from our own Caity Weaver: \"IT'S LIKE SHE TOOK AN AMBIEN AND WASHED IT DOWN WITH PINOT.\" Wouldn't be the first time. ||||| Once again, Diane Sawyer helped to lead ABC's Election Night coverage, and once again, she appeared entirely intoxicated while doing so. At least, that's what Twitter thought. As the last of the polls closed on Tuesday night, \"Diane Sawyer\" became a trending topic and not in a good way. John Gruber who runs the blog Daring Fireball tweeted, \"Swear to god, Diane Sawyer is drunker than I am.\" The popular 90s band They Might Be Giants chimed in, \"And Diane Sawyer declares tonight's winner is... chardonnay!\" New York Times media report Brian Stelter cut Sawyer some slack, \"Diane Sawyer's name is trending. Many people saying she seems drunk on air. Alternative theory: she gets this way when she's really tired.\" \n \n Stelter's on to something. We've seen Diane Sawyer in this state before. The night after Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009, Sawyer appeared pretty cheerful on Good Morning America. She also had a hard time putting sentences together which led many to draw the conclusion that she was still drunk from the night before. Then, like now, we're not sure the slurred words and excessive smiles are necessarily proof that Sawyer had done some drinking, but she does look a little bit out of character. Oh well. We all do weird things when we're tired. \n \n Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments. You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire. \n \n Adam Clark Estes\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIf you were watching ABC's election coverage last night, there was probably just one question on your mind: Is Diane Sawyer really drunk, or just tired? Gawker has an amusing video montage that seems to support what many assumed: She was smashed. The video pieces together clips of Sawyer slurring and stumbling over her words, swaying in her seat, vehemently complaining about the lack of music, rambling about the exclamation point in Obama's campaign slogan, and at one point intensely reminding viewers that people have \"died—literally died\" for the right to vote. All the while, George Stephanopoulos looks on with, at times, apparent frustration at his inability to get a word in. The Atlantic Wire rounds up some of the better tweets about the situation (\"And Diane Sawyer declares tonight's winner is … chardonnay!\"), and has yet more video evidence that we've seen Sawyer like this in the past. But its conclusion is that Sawyer simply gets weird when she's tired. Meanwhile, another news anchor also made headlines last night: On NBC, Brian Williams totally \"crushed\" Donald Trump, Business Insider reports. Williams reluctantly reported on Trump's Twitter feed, noting that Trump had \"driven well past the last exit to relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible\" with his angry election-related tweets. Williams then read some of the tweets on air, before ending with, \"So, that happened.\" Click for a third buzzed-about media moment of the night.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe body of Sydney Loofe, 24, was found, according to her family. She’d been missing for more than two weeks after going on a date with a woman she met online. Lincoln Police Department Courtesy photo ||||| CLOSE “Ready for my date,” were the last four words anyone heard or read from Sydney Loofe on November 15th. Three weeks later, her body was found. Buzz60 \n \n Sydney Loofe was last seen on the evening of November 16. (Photo: FBI via Twitter) \n \n Authorities have recovered the body of a Nebraska woman whose disappearance after a Tinder date last month triggered a massive search and bizarre social media posts from two persons of interest in the tragic mystery. \n \n Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister said Tuesday that \"analysis of digital evidence\" led authorities to a body in rural Clay County they believe is that of Sydney Loofe, 24, who vanished three weeks ago. \n \n \"We do believe that there is evidence of foul play,\" Bliemeister said. \n \n Bliemeister expressed a \"strong belief\" that the body is that of Loofe, who was reported missing Nov. 16 after failing to show up at her job at a Lincoln home improvement store. He said formal confirmation would be made in the coming days. \n \n Bliemeister provided no further details on the cause of death or circumstances surrounding the discovery. Investigators had been using Loofe's cellphone signal to retrace her movements in the hours before she disappeared. \n \n More: Police: Missing Florida teen found safe in New York \n \n More: Hunter charged in killing of neighbor while shooting after sunset \n \n Loofe’s parents, George and Susie Loofe, acknowledged their daughter's death on their \"Finding Sydney Loofe\" Facebook page. \n \n \"It's with heavy hearts that we share this most recent update with you all,\" the couple said. \"Please continue to pray for Sydney and our entire family. May God grant eternal rest unto thee. We love you Sydney.\" \n \n Bliemeister said the persons of interest, Aubrey Trail, 51, and Bailey Boswell, 23, remained in custody but had not been charged in the case. Both apparently left the state in the days after Loofe disappeared and were arrested Thursday near Branson, Mo., on unrelated charges. \n \n Social media posts indicate Loofe went on a date Nov. 15 with Boswell, who has confirmed on social media that she met Loofe via the dating app Tinder. \n \n Boswell and roommate, Aubrey Trail, 51, live in the eastern Nebraska town of Wilber, about 40 miles south of Lincoln and the last place Loofe was seen alive. Trail and Boswell posted videos on social media last week proclaiming their innocence and claiming their efforts to speak with Lincoln police had been largely rebuffed. \n \n Boswell, wearing a hoodie and sunglasses in a video, said she dropped Loofe off at a friend’s house after their date and never heard from her again. Bliemeister said authorities thus far have been unable to confirm Boswell's timeline. \n \n Trail said on his video that he \"wasn't running from anything.\" He said he was praying for Sydney and wished the best for her family. \n \n \"We're continuing to speak with Aubrey Trail and we'll continue to do so as long as he's willing,\" Bliemeister said Tuesday. \n \n Bliemeister said police believe that there is no continuing threat to the public. But he provided no motive for the murder and stressed that no one had been charged. \n \n \"By their own statements on social media, we believe that Aubrey Trail and Bailey Boswell were two of the last people to see her before her disappearance,\" Bliemeister said. \"Thus they remain persons of interest.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nvPwxp ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded. \n \n Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n \n This feature is not available right now.

On Tuesday, their three-week search for the 24-year-old Nebraska woman came to a close with the discovery of a body in Clay County, about 90 miles from Loofe's Lincoln Home, per the Kansas City Star. Foul play is suspected, Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister tells USA Today. Bailey Boswell, 23, who posted a video online in which she said she dropped Loofe off at a friend's house after their date, and her male roommate, 51-year-old Aubrey Trail, are considered persons of interest in the case, police add. Both were jailed last week on unrelated charges. Police haven't commented on how Loofe is believed to have died, or on a possible motive for her killing, but they say \"digital evidence\" led them to the body. They also say data from Loofe's cellphone indicated she had been in the area of Boswell and Trail's Wilber home, 40 miles from her own. But though Boswell says Loofe smoked marijuana there on Nov. 15, she denied any wrongdoing in a nine-minute video posted online on Nov. 29, showing Boswell and Trail together in a car, per the Omaha World-Herald. A day later, Boswell and Trail were arrested near Branson, Mo. \"By their own statements on social media, we believe that Aubrey Trail and Bailey Boswell were two of the last people to see [Loofe] before her disappearance,\" Bliemeister says. \"Thus they remain persons of interest.\" (Police say a teen murder suspect in Colorado had a kill list.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

He is also a member of the football team. \n \n According to police, Cordaro was able to travel about a quarter of a mile before driving off the roadway and ending up in a flower bed. \n \n The ambulance was damaged and was towed away. \n \n Court paperwork stated when Cordaro was taken in custody, he said, \"You got me...do whatever you need to do.\" As he was being handcuffed, he reportedly said, \"It was stupid, it was stupid.\" \n \n Cordaro registered a .09 percent BAC when he was subjected to a breathalyzer test. Court papers said he told police he had been drinking beers and manhattans. \n \n The 22-year-old was taken into custody and charged with grand larceny, criminal mischief, DWI and other violations. \n \n The judge set his bail at $1,500 and remanded him to the Monroe County Jail. \n \n The University of Rochester did not comment on his graduating status.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIf you're bored on the University of Rochester campus after the bars let out, don't do as this student did: Police say 22-year-old Robert Cordaro Jr. hopped into a Rural Metro ambulance around 2:20am Thursday and drove a quarter of a mile until he crashed into a flower bed, per WHAM. Cordaro was charged with grand larceny, criminal mischief, and DUI. In an equally strange case in South Dakota, authorities say Damon Andrews, 18, crashed a stolen car into a yard at 1:25am Sunday.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIt has taken thousands of years, but a combination of 21st-century forensic science and luck has finally revealed what happened to Tutankhamun – the world's most famous pharaoh. \n \n Mystery has surrounded the boy king ever since his death in 1323BC, aged 19. The mystery intensified when the archaeologist Lord Carnarvon died in Cairo shortly after he and Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. \n \n Now British experts think they have solved the riddle of the king's death. They believe injuries on his body are akin to those sustained in a chariot accident and that his mummification was botched. \n \n Dr Chris Naunton, director of the Egypt Exploration Society, was intrigued when he came across references in Carter's records of the body having been burnt. A clue came from Dr Robert Connolly, an anthropologist at Liverpool University, who was part of the team that X-rayed Tutankhamun's remains in 1968. Among the bones in his office he recently found a piece of the pharaoh's flesh – the only known sample outside Egypt. \n \n Working with forensic archaeologist Dr Matthew Ponting, Dr Connolly used a scanning electron microscope to determine that the flesh had been burnt. Subsequent chemical tests confirmed that Tutankhamun's body was burnt while sealed inside his coffin. Researchers discovered that embalming oils combined with oxygen and linen caused a chemical reaction which \"cooked\" the king's body at temperatures of more than 200C. Dr Chris Naunton said: \"The charring and possibility that a botched mummification led the body spontaneously combusting shortly after burial was entirely unexpected, something of a revelation.\" \n \n Working with scientists from the Cranfield Forensic Institute, researchers performed a \"virtual autopsy\" which revealed a pattern of injuries down one side of his body. Their investigation also explains why King Tut's mummy was the only pharaoh to be missing its heart: it had been damaged beyond repair. \n \n The pharaoh's injuries have been matched to a specific scenario – with car-crash investigators creating computer simulations of chariot accidents. The results suggest a chariot smashed into him while he was on his knees – shattering his ribs and pelvis and crushing his heart. \n \n The new findings will be shown for the first time in Channel 4's 'Tutankhamun: The Mystery of the Burnt Mummy' next Sunday at 8pm ||||| Egyptologist finds evidence that ‘King Tut’ spontaneously combusted \n \n By Scott Kaufman \n \n Sunday, November 3, 2013 14:50 EST \n \n According to a Channel 4 documentary, evidence shows that the embalmed body of the most famous Egyptian pharaoh spontaneously combusted inside its sarcophagus. \n \n “Tutankhamun: The Mystery of the Burnt Mummy” examines not only how the young pharaoh died, but what happened to his body after it was interred. \n \n Egyptologist Chris Nauton, the director of the Egypt Exploration Society, and a team of car crash investigators ran computer simulations that lend credence to the increasingly accepted theory that Tutankhamun was killed in a chariot accident. The simulations showed that the injuries scaling down one side of his body are consistent with a high-speed collision. \n \n But it is the possibility of a botched mummification and its consequences that really interest Nauton. \n \n “Despite all the attention Tut’s mummy has received over the years the full extent of its strange condition has largely been overlooked,” he said. “The charring and possibility that a botched mummification led the body spontaneously combusting shortly after burial was entirely unexpected, something of a revelation in fact.” \n \n Nauton discovered a post-mortem exam from the 1960s in which a scanning electron microscope indicated that the mummy’s flesh was burnt. His research discovered that the embalming oils used at the time of Tutankhamun’s death can, in the presence of oxygen and treated linen, cause a chemical reaction capable of “cooking” a human body. \n \n The documentary airs on Sunday, November 10 in the U.K. \n \n [\"Tut Ench Amun\" on Shutterstock] ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe story of King Tut's death—and what followed—just got even more interesting, all thanks to a single piece of flesh. That remnant of Tutankhamun is the only one of its kind known to exist outside Egypt, and British experts decided to analyze it after stumbling upon a decades-old record by one of the archaeologists who found Tut's tomb in 1922. That record indicated the body had been burnt, and a scanning electron microscope and chemical tests proved that was indeed the case, reports the Independent. But here's the truly intriguing part: The body caught afire after it was sealed in its sarcophagus, essentially \"spontaneously combusting,\" says Egyptologist Chris Nauton. The scientists' theory is that the mummification was bungled and that the body caught fire due to an unfortunate chemical reaction spurred by the combination of oxygen, embalming oils, and linen; the temperature would have reached 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Raw Story adds that the researchers also partnered with a team of car crash investigators whose computer simulations seem to verify the leading theory as to cause of death: a chariot accident. The injuries sustained on one side of his body (as revealed by what the Independent calls a \"virtual autopsy\") suggest a chariot crashed into Tut while he was on his knees, crushing his heart. The findings will be presented in a documentary airing Sunday in Britain. Scientists believe Tutankhamun may have fallen from the chariot while hunting.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA California State Parks ranger was placed on leave after he was found intoxicated and asleep in his patrol car with a beer between his legs, officials said. \n \n A passerby stumbled upon the ranger, Tyson Young, on the afternoon of Aug. 15 in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, which is off Highway 101 south of Eureka, according to the California Highway Patrol. \n \n After trying unsuccessfully to wake up the ranger, the passerby snapped a picture of Young, who was sleeping soundly with a Keystone Light snugly tucked between his legs.

A passerby (who's staying anonymous) found him passed out and intoxicated on State Route 254 in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, officials say. Afraid Young was injured, the passerby called out to him and banged the hood, but no luck, Last Coast Outpost reports. \"I shook him, really shook him,\" said the man. \"And then I saw the beer between his legs.\" So the guy called 911 and snapped the ranger's photo while waiting (the Chronicle has the pic). Young came to and drove off, but the CHP soon pulled him over. \"Young displayed objective symptoms of intoxication and was detained for a DUI investigation,\" said a CHP officer. Young was arrested for DUI and put on administrative leave during the investigation. \"We do not tolerate the use of alcohol in the workplace,\" said a State Parks spokesperson. \"We take matters like this very seriously.\" Young was the supervising ranger for two state parks, the North Coast Journal reports.\n#END SUMMARY"}

making . in this case, \n intraoperative frozen section enabled us to correctly identify the pathology and perform the near - total resection . \n after the intraoperative diagnosis of meningioma is confirmed for an extradural spinal lesion, gross total resection of the tumor including extensions into the bone or the paraspinal space should be conducted . \n this approach is likely to give the best results since the prognosis of this tumor depends on the extent of resection . \n intraoperatively, we were able to strip off the tumor from the spinal dura, without excising the dura to expose the shining white dura underneath [ figure 6 ], as these extradural spinal meningiomas arise from the dural root sleeve and not from the external surface of the spinal dura . \n most meningiomas are benign, well -

The website was announced today (Nov. 19) here at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association. \n \n To rank the restaurants, the researchers turned to a database called MenuStat to collect published nutrition information on menu items. \n \n Then, the researchers gave food items a nutrition score out of 100, based on their nutrient content and the percentage of fruits, nuts and vegetables that the item had. Menu items that scored above 64 on nutrient content, and had fewer than 700 calories, were considered healthy. \n \n The researchers created an algorithm to score menu items, but some items did not have enough information in the database to be scored, so the researchers turned to crowdsourcing. Participants underwent a brief training to learn how much fruit, vegetables and nuts were in certain foods, and then rated the fruit, vegetable and nut content of menu items, Lesser said. [Lose Weight Smartly: 7 Little-Known Tricks That Shave Pounds] \n \n Here are the 10 healthiest restaurant chains (with their scores), according to the site: \n \n 1.

El Pollo Loco (36) \n \n The Grellin website not only lets people see which restaurants are ranked as the healthiest, but also lets consumers view which menu items are healthy at any given restaurant. The website also gives each menu item a \"run score,\" which corresponds to how many hours someone would have to run to burn off the calories in that food, Lesser said. \n \n Some restaurants did not provide enough information to receive a Grellin grade, and these restaurants are marked on the website with a dash, in no particular order. \n \n The website is currently limited to chain restaurants, but the researchers are looking to expand the rankings to include nonchain restaurants, Lesser said. \n \n Follow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner.

The vast California park, to which 1.3 million visitors flock annually, is celebrating 123 years of sequoias, waterfalls and breathtaking vistas that stretch over 760,000 acres. This year’s anniversary is particularly notable, as the park survived last month’s record-setting fire more or less intact. \n \n Fittingly, today’s Google Doodle was designed in Yosemite’s honor. Unfortunately, if you click on the doodle, and then on one of the first pages that shows up in your search results, you get this: \n \n Happy birthday, Yosemite. ||||| One of the last remaining veterans of World War II in Congress called Thursday afternoon for his colleagues to end the government shutdown, suggesting that members of the legislative body who have appeared at the World War II memorial this week are not doing enough to support those who served in the conflict. \n \n “If this Congress truly wishes to recognize the sacrifice and bravery of our World War II veterans and all who’ve come after, it will end this shutdown and re-open our government now,” John Dingell, (D-Mich.), said in a joint statement issued with former Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, a combat-injured veteran of World War II. \n \n The Department of Veterans Affairs warned this week that its progress is cutting the backlog of disability claims by 30 percent over the last six months is likely to be reversed by the shutdown. The department said that it is no longer able to pay overtime to claims processors, an initiative begun in May that officials say was supposed to continue until November. \n \n “The current shutdown has slowed the rate at which the government can process veterans’ disability claims and, as the VA has stated, it is negatively impacting other services to our nation’s veterans,” Dingell and Dole said in their statement. \n \n Dingell and Rep. Ralph Hall, (R-Tex.), are the only veterans of World War II remaining in Congress. \n \n Several veterans groups, including the American Legion, have issued statements calling for an end to the shutdown. \n \n “The American Legion wants Congress to stop its bickering and stop making America’s veterans suffer for its own lack of political resolve in the face of this national crisis,” the organization said Thursday.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe World War II Memorial in Washington is currently barricaded, thanks to the government shutdown, but that didn't stop a group of WWII vets from entering it today. The group, part of an honor flight program from Mississippi, had chartered an airplane and made plans too far in advance to change the trip. US Park Police allowed their bus to stop (\"I'm a veteran myself,\" says one), and members of Congress led them into the memorial—where they shouted and \"surged\" in as the barricades were moved, the Washington Post reports. In other strange shutdown news, today's Google Doodle honors Yosemite National Park's 123rd birthday ... but, as Salon points out, all national parks are currently closed, so if you click on the doodle and then on one of the top search results, you'll see the following message instead of the park's website: \"Because of the federal government shutdown, all national parks are closed and National Park Service webpages are not operating.\" Click for more on the shutdown.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nEditor’s note: Jamal Khashoggi is a Saudi journalist and author, and a columnist for Washington Post Global Opinions. Khashoggi’s words should appear in the space above, but he has not been heard from since he entered a Saudi consulate in Istanbul for a routine consular matter on Tuesday afternoon. \n \n Read the Washington Post editorial: Where is Jamal Khashoggi? ||||| Image copyright Washington Post Image caption The blank column appears online and in the print edition \n \n The Washington Post has printed a blank column in support of its missing Saudi contributor Jamal Khashoggi. \n \n Mr Khashoggi - a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - has not been seen since visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Tuesday. \n \n Saudi Arabia says he left the building but Turkey says he may still be inside. \n \n The newspaper said it was \"worried\" and called on Mr bin Salman to \"welcome constructive criticism from patriots such as Mr Khashoggi\". \n \n In an editorial, it asked that the crown prince do \"everything in his power\" to let the journalist work. \n \n Previously an adviser to senior Saudi officials, Mr Khashoggi moved abroad after his Saudi newspaper column was cancelled and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting his criticisms of the crown prince's policies. \n \n The 59-year-old commentator has been living in self-imposed exile in the US and working as a contributor to the Washington Post. \n \n What happened on Tuesday? \n \n Mr Khashoggi went to the Istanbul consulate to obtain official divorce documents so that he could marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice. \n \n He left his phone with Hatice outside the consulate and asked her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia needs reform, but one-man rule is \"bad\" for the kingdom \n \n Hatice said she waited for Mr Khashoggi outside the consulate from about 13:00 (10:00 GMT) until after midnight and did not see him leave. She returned when the consulate reopened on Wednesday morning. \n \n What do Saudi Arabia and Turkey say? \n \n Turkey has said it believes he remains inside the building, while a Saudi official said Mr Khashoggi filled out his paperwork and then \"exited shortly thereafter\". \n \n On Thursday the official Saudi Press Agency cited the consulate as saying it was working with Turkish authorities to probe Mr Khashoggi's disappearance \"after he left the consulate building\". \n \n The US state department has also requested information about Khashoggi's whereabouts and expressed concern about his safety. \n \n The BBC's Mark Lowen says the mystery threatens to deepen the strains in the relationship between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. \n \n Turkey has taken the side of Qatar over its blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours, and Turkey's rapprochement with Iran has riled the government in Riyadh, our correspondent adds. \n \n Why might Saudi Arabia want Khashoggi? \n \n He is one of the most prominent critics of the crown prince, who has unveiled reforms praised by the West while carrying out an apparent crackdown on dissent, which has seen human and women's rights activists, intellectuals and clerics arrested, and waging a war in Yemen that has triggered a humanitarian crisis. \n \n A former editor of the al-Watan newspaper and a short-lived Saudi TV news channel, Mr Khashoggi was for years seen as close to the Saudi royal family and advised senior Saudi officials. \n \n After several of his friends were arrested, his column was cancelled by the Al-Hayat newspaper and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting, Mr Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for the US, from where he wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and continued to appear on Arab and Western TV channels. \n \n \"I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,\" he wrote in September 2017. \"To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe Washington Post has printed one of the most unusual op-ed pieces in its history. It consists of a byline—that of Jamal Khashoggi—and then is followed by blank space. In both its print and online versions, the space where Khashoggi's column should be has been left deliberately empty, reports the BBC. It's the newspaper's way of protesting the journalist's disappearance in Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi, a frequent critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since Tuesday. He visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on that day, and while the Saudis say he left the building, Turkish officials say they don't think he did. The Post also has an editorial about the situation in which it asks the crown prince to make sure that Khashoggi is OK. The piece notes that the de facto Saudi leader is trying to modernize his nation's image by doing away with its authoritarian old ways. \"If he is truly committed to this, he will welcome constructive criticism from patriots such as Mr. Khashoggi,\" says the editorial. \"And he will do everything in his power to ensure that Mr. Khashoggi is free and able to continue his work.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nMedia and the left going crazy over Ted Nugent comments Wednesday, Apr 18, 2012 at 3:31 PM EDT \n \n Your browser does not support iframes. \n \n Did Ted Nugent really threaten the life of the President or was he just trying to galvanize the crowd at the NRA to vote and encourage other conservatives to vote?

Wood, Wagner and Walken had all been drinking heavily before the actress disappeared. The original detective on the case, Wagner and Walken have all said they considered her death an accident. \n \n Bruises on Wood's arms, a scratch on her neck and superficial abrasions to her face may have occurred before Wood ended up in the waters off Catalina Island in November 1981, but coroner's officials wrote they could not definitely determine when the injuries occurred. \n \n \"The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,\" says the report, written by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. \"Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined.\" \n \n Officials also considered that Wood wasn't wearing a life jacket and had no history of suicide attempts and didn't leave a note as reasons to amend the report and the death certificate. \n \n The newly released report also says there are conflicting statements about when the boat's occupants discovered Wood was missing. The report estimates her time of death was around midnight, and she was reported missing at 1:30 a.m. \n \n Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing. ||||| Actress Natalie Wood in 1963 / AP Photo \n \n (CBS/AP) LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is expected to release a new report Monday in the drowning of actress Natalie Wood more than 30 years ago. \n \n 48 Hours Presents Vanity Fair: Hollywood Scandal \n \n Sources told CBS News the review of the 1981 coroner's report questions the findings that led investigators to conclude Wood's death was an accident. \n \n \n \n Sources say the new report concludes that the bruising on the actress' wrists, knees, and ankles could be more consistent with injuries from an assault than they were from struggling to climb back on a boat. \n \n \n \n Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht shared by Wood, her actor-husband Robert Wagner and their friend, actor Christopher Walken, have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. Authorities have previously said Wagner is not a suspect in his wife's death. \n \n Investigators re-opened the case in Nov. 2011, after the boat's captain, Dennis Davern, told \"48 Hours Mystery\" and the \"Today\" show that he heard Wagner and Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Wagner was to blame for her death. \n \n Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed that his wife and a dinghy attached to the yacht were missing. \n \n Wood was nominated for three Academy Awards during her lifetime.

He refused to rule out \"non-volitional, unplanned entry into the water\" but left her cause of death \"undetermined,\" the LA Times reports. The actor's drowning was considered accidental until Dennis Davern, the pilot of the boat she shared with actor-husband Robert Wagner, gave a TV interview blaming Wagner for her death, CBS reports. The LA County Sheriff's Department reopened the investigation in 2011, which led to today's report. But a lack of evidence leaves open the chance that Wood was hurt trying to tie a dinghy to the boat. Her actual injuries: superficial abrasions to the face, a scratch on her neck, and bruises on her arms, reports the AP. (According to unearthed audiotapes, Wagner actually pushed Wood off the boat.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Participants climb one of the silo’s towers, then transfer to a wooden platform and jump off while attached to a rope. \n \n Users fall for about 20 feet (6 meters) and are caught by the device and lowered slowly to the ground. \n \n Get Air says it is cooperating with investigators. \n \n Information from: The Daily Sentinel ||||| GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - News Channel 5 has obtained the Grand Junction Police Department's investigation into the death of Ciara Romero at the Get Air Silo Trampoline Park. \n \n The GJPD has announced no criminal charges will be filed. \n \n Romero was one of a group of five using the \"Quick Jump\" free fall device on January 4th and by multiple accounts from witnesses and employees, Romero was hesitant to jump. \n \n \"She was hesitant you know, pretty freaked out,\" the employee at the bottom of the silo told police, \"Kind of scared, but excited to go.\" \n \n Employees at both the top and the bottom of the silo told police they were \"confident\" the harness had been attached properly. \n \n Video reviewed by police shows the employee at the top of the silo pulling up on the harness with force to confirm it was attached. \n \n The report says at one point Romero sat down. Afterwards, the employee at the top checked the harness again. \n \n \"I saw the carabiner that was attached to her harness. It caught like it was normally supposed to,\" the employee at the bottom of the Silo told police. \"I saw that she was falling much faster and so I just instinctively tried to get underneath her.\" \n \n Multiple people at Get Air rushed to help, including a former ICU nurse. That person recalled checking for a pulse and felt a light one initially as well as hearing a gasping breath. \n \n The former nurse checked for a pulse again, but was unable to find one, and began two rounds of CPR. \n \n The employee at the top of the Silo, noticeably shaking when talking to police the report notes, said it was possible Romero's hand slipped and opened the carabineer during the initial jump but thought that would have been difficult to do. \n \n \"[They are] designed to be difficult to remove with someone's body weight keeping tension on the line,\" the employee told police. \n \n A GJPD officer investigated the carabiner to find that it can be opened with one or two hands. \n \n \"I found the carabiner to be relatively easy to open with one hand and believe a patron could inadvertently open the device with out knowing,\" Detective Heil said in the report, noting no flaws or damage on the device. \n \n The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment is investigating this incident as well and tells News Channel 5 they expect the results this week.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAuthorities in Colorado are investigating how a 20-year-old nurse died in a bungee jump accident—when the equipment was apparently working properly. Ciara Romero died after a fall Jan. 4 at the 70-foot Get Air attraction at the Silo Trampoline Park in Grand Junction, the Denver Post reports. The jump requires participants to jump off a tower connected to a rope attached to a harness. After free-falling for around 20 feet, they are supposed be caught by the device and slowly lowered to the ground. The Grand Junction Sentinel reports that in results confirmed by state investigators, the company that makes the device says it carried out tests and the \"device, webbing, and triple-locking carabiner were found to be intact, and functioning normally.\" State investigators say they will now focus on witness statements, and the Grand Junction Police Department says no criminal charges will be filed. According a a police report seen by News Channel 5, employees and other witnesses said Romero was reluctant to jump. \"She was hesitant, you know, pretty freaked out,\" one employee told police, \"Kind of scared, but excited to go.\" Video shows employees checking to make sure the harness was properly attached, the report says. The report states that an employee told investigators that it was possible Romero's hand could have slipped and opened the carabiner. The employee said this would have been very difficult, though an officer wrote that he \"found the carabiner to be relatively easy to open with one hand\" and believes it could have happened accidentally.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIt's here!! \n \n Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill have finally blessed us with their sexy spread for GQ's October issue! \n \n And besides the two claiming they're not actually engaged, it seems this editorial is really what's going to convince people to take their relationship seriously. \n \n Related: Nicki Shows Off Her Killer Body In A Mesh Outfit! \n \n After all, the Anaconda rapper never did a shoot with her ex, Safaree Samuels! \n \n Anyway, we got a glimpse of the rappers' spread in their BTS video, but the actual pictures are way hotter!! \n \n Just take a peek at Nicki's Alexander Wang outfit and Giuseppe Zanotti heels! \n \n Need we say more?? \n \n So read on for the HIGHlights and get to know these two better.

WHY?!?!?!According to our sources, producers were particularly upset over her car accident on PCH. We're told the producers have five big concerns:-- The company that insures the movie might bail-- Her probation could be violated for lying to the cops-- She could be prosecuted for lying to police-- She could crash her car again-- She's going to clubs where bad things happenBut here's the thing ... when has a Lifetime movie ever gotten this much press (besides the one where played a hooker )? And don't they know ... nothing bad ever REALLY happens to Lindsay.$10 says \"Liz & Dick\" is the most watched program in the network's history. ||||| Never a dull moment in the life of Lindsay Lohan and those she comes into contact with: Two Hollywood unions are investigating working conditions on the set of \"Liz & Dick,\" the actress' Lifetime movie, after Lohan was found unresponsive and required medical attention and two crew members left the project. \n \n \"Liz & Dick\" tells the story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Filming the project has proven somewhat difficult for Lohan, who was not only the subject of hospitalization rumors (Lohan was later said to be asleep -- not unconscious -- and never went to the hospital) but also crashed her car while driving in Los Angeles. \n \n Two other crew members were actually sent to the hospital for exhaustion and dehydration. Lohan tweeted that she had been working 85 hours in four days. SAG-AFTRA confirmed to THR that they were looking into the matter and said they were not yet prepared to report their findings. Though IATSE declined comment to THR, sources said that union's agents were indeed looking into the matter. \n \n As for Lohan, reports of concerned family members continue to surface. One industry source told The Huffington Post that Lohan was viewed as a \"ticking time bomb,\" a macabre reference the source explained by adding, \"If Lindsay hadn’t been making a movie, who would have called for help? As soon as filming wraps, she will be all alone again.\" \n \n The 25-year-old actress is under a great deal of pressure to orchestrate a comeback before her star -- already tarnished by multiple run-ins with the legal system -- fades beyond repair. \n \n Earlier: Lohan's on-set wardrobe malfunction, the whole story of her medical scare and family and friends concerns. \n \n Also on HuffPost: ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThough they should have known what they were in for the moment they hired her, the producers of Lindsay Lohan's upcoming Lifetime movie are reportedly \"hysterical\" over the actress' recent car crash and exhaustion incident. Sources tell TMZ the producers are particularly worried they may lose their insurance over the car crash, or that Lindsay could face legal issues for lying to police … or that she could simply get into yet more trouble of some other sort, whether car-related or nightclub-related. They're probably also not too happy that LiLo's explanation for her exhaustion (\"working 85hours in 4days, and being up all night shooting,\" she tweeted) ended up getting the working conditions on the set investigated by two Hollywood unions. But Perez Hilton notes that some crew members say Lohan was exaggerating, and absolutely \"did not work 85 hours in four days.\" TMZ points out that this is quite a bit of publicity, however, and that Lifetime could end up quite happy if it boosts the ratings for Liz & Dick.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nhowever despite the introduction of more advanced surgical techniques, there remains a significant risk of complications and death from surgical procedures ( 1 ) . \n previous studies have shown that over 50% of surgical complications are avoidable ( 2 ) . \n in addition, the importance of effective teamwork has been established and been shown to improve outcome ( 3 ) . \n consequently, the world health organisation ( who ) developed the surgical safety checklist in 2008 ( 4 ) . following the introduction of the who surgical safety checklist, \n a large global multi -

One participant pulled out a small nonlethal pistol and fired repeatedly. \n \n The victim was hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening. The weapon fired plastic bullets or blanks. Neither person was identified. \n \n It was not clear which of Kant's ideas may have triggered the violence.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA spate of odd news today concerning attacks in Russia: one on a dance floor, three in a cemetery, and another over a philosopher. Two 20-something men in line for beers at a festival in southern Russia, got in a heated dispute about 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant. The feud \"deteriorated into a fistfight,\" police said today, and one of the men eventually shot the other in the head with an air gun—multiple times, the AP notes. The victim survived; the attacker could be in prison for a decade, RIA Novosti adds. Police arrested a 36-year-old woman after she allegedly stabbed another woman at a birthday party; the 21-year-old victim was apparently dancing with the attacker's boyfriend, RIA Novosti reports. The alleged attacker \"took a knife, approached the dancing woman, and stabbed her twice,\" investigators say. The victim died in the hospital. A guilty verdict could mean 15 years in prison for the suspect. A man has been convicted of killing his mother, brother, and father in a cemetery. They were reportedly living in the graveyard after he evicted them, and when his mother accused him of the eviction, he hit her. His brother stepped in, and the man ended up stabbing both of them—and killing his father, who'd seen the attack.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nSee more of Lauren Michele Emerson on Facebook ||||| When flight attendant Lauren Gibbs boarded the plane to Detroit to Oklahoma City just before Christmas, she already knew it was a special day. \n \n Gibbs, 23, from Nashville, Tennessee, would be in control of the cabin, while her boyfriend, pilot Jon Emerson, was on the flight deck. Not only that, but it was their anniversary. \n \n But she was in for a surprise when Emerson, 24, made the pre-flight announcements to the cabin. \n \n After informing them about the flight time (2 hours 30 minutes), altitude (36,000 feet) and likelihood of turbulence (“a few light bumps in the air”), Emerson got personal. \n \n Introducing Gibbs to the cabin, he said: “This is a very special day for Lauren and me. It’s our anniversary today and she’s one of our very best flight attendants.” \n \n He went on: “I want this day to be known for the rest of our lives. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.” \n \n He then whipped out an engagement ring, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. \n \n The answer was an enthusiastic yes, and the whole thing was filmed by an off-duty pilot sitting in first class, whom Emerson had primed in advance. \n \n “I was caught so off guard,” Gibbs told The Independent. “Jon is a really quiet guy, with a very shy personality so for him to do it in front of passengers was so not like him, but for me it was perfect and so thoughtful. We spend almost all of our time together on planes and working together so the timing and place was absolutely perfect.” \n \n The couple – who asked The Independent not to name the airline they work for – met when they were assigned a trip together, and have flown together ever since, turning their long layovers into “mini vacations”. \n \n Emerson and Gibb met on a flight and have been together ever since (Lauren Gibb) \n \n “The best thing about having a pilot as my significant other is always having someone there after a long day of working,” Gibbs told The Independent. “Layovers can be really boring so always having someone there with me makes the experience so much better.” \n \n Emerson had spent the past three months planning the proposal for their 23 December anniversary, he said. \n \n So will the wedding be onboard a plane? “I think Jon would absolutely love to have planes involved for our wedding,” says Gibbs. “However we will probably have something more quiet and smaller for our friends and family.” The planning has yet to start, though, so there’s always time to change her mind. \n \n Click here to compare flight options with Skyscanner\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nCall it the tamer (and more romantic) version of the Mile High Club, before the plane even left the ground. The Independent reports on an airline pilot who decided to surprise his flight attendant girlfriend, who works with him, two days before Christmas. As Jon Emerson, 24, gave passengers weather, altitude, and turbulence details before their SkyWest flight took off from Detroit to Oklahoma City, he suddenly changed the subject. He introduced 23-year-old Lauren Gibbs as his girlfriend, and also as \"one of our very best flight attendants,\" then said he wanted her to not only remember this day as their anniversary, but also as a \"day to be known for the rest of our lives.\" In a video Gibbs posted to her Facebook page, Emerson can then be seen whipping out a ring box and getting down on one knee in front of Gibbs to offer his marriage proposal amid clapping and cheers from the flight's passengers. (Emerson headed back to the PA system to note, \"She said yes\" for those who couldn't hear in the back.) \"I got to say the easiest YES of my life to my best friend!\" Gibbs writes in her post. \"It still feels like a dream and I cannot explain how blessed I am to spend forever with Jon.\" She included the hashtag #LaurenLandedEmerson, then added a bit of news about the venue for their nuptials: \"Sorry to disappoint, but the wedding will not be on a plane!\" (Another holiday season proposal, this one in subzero temperatures.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nmedian sternotomy for open cardiac procedure is a bone splitting procedure that can be complicated by poor healing, resulting in sternal dehiscence at an incidence of 0.5 - 5% with or without infection [ 1, 2 ] . \n higher risk group are those with obesity, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus and patients on long - term immunosuppressive drugs . \n surgical technique also contributes in particular to off midline sternotomy   and poor closure technique . \n sternal dehiscence may further complicate the post - operative period with superficial wound infections, mediastinitis, pain, and cardiac and pulmonary function compromise . \n repair of sternal dehiscence is guided by radiological and intra - operative findings . in the present case, \n recent publications have supported the safe use of this novel sternal closure technique, and our patient had successful repair with no reported no long - term complications . a male and female sternal talon component is placed intercostally on either side of split vertical sternal segments following width and depth measurements . both components are reduced and locked in place to achieve accurate and secure reduction . long - term removal can be achieved by unlocking the screw after exposure and dissection . in conclusion, we have reported a case of non - infected sternal dehiscence managed successfully with the sternal talon without long - term complications .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nSternal dehiscence is a recognised complication after median sternotomy, occurring in 0.5 - 5% of cases with or without infection.a 72-year - old man presenting with collapse and ventricular tachycardia was investigated for a possible acute cardiac event 2 years after coronary artery bypass grafting for ischemic heart disease . \n work - up chest x - ray showed displacement of all sternal wires, and computed tomography ( ct ) performed to investigate further showed sternal dehiscence with right ventricle wall herniation through the defect and sternal wire breakdown . \n a decision was made after discussion with the patient to repair the defect using 3 sternal talon devices and 2 sternal wires . \n the patient made an uncomplicated recovery, and the outpatient clinic review after discharge home showed satisfactory and stable sternal union . \n we report a case of non - infected sternal dehiscence managed successfully with the sternal talon without long - term complications .\n#END SUMMARY"}

Image: weibo \n \n The unnamed passenger later told staff that it was her first time onboard an airplane and she had thought that there was another bathroom behind the emergency exit door. She was trying to avoid the snaking queue for the real bathroom when the incident took place. \n \n Although no one was injured, airport authorities are investigating the disturbance. Chinese civil aviation law dictates that passengers found to endanger flight safety can be held criminally liable. \n \n Just earlier this month, a man caused flight delays on a China Southern Airlines flight when he opened the plane's emergency exit door to get some fresh air. \n \n Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments. ||||| The cabin crew and passengers on China Southern Airlines flight CZ3693 got a rude shock Wednesday morning when a passenger onboard the flight opened the emergency exit door before takeoff from Chengdu Airport. \n \n According to the offending passenger, he was just trying to \"get some fresh air\" and had mistaken the door handle as a lever to open the plane's windows, reported Chengdu Commercial News. \n \n The plane was carrying a total of 130 passengers and was bound for Urumqi, China. \n \n Due to the incident, the flight was delayed for over an hour. While the crew investigated the matter, airport ground staff proceeded to shut the door from the outside and carried out last-minute safety checks. \n \n Chengdu airport ground staff closing the door from the outside. Image: Weibo \n \n The offence of the unauthorised opening of a plane's emergency exit door is a fine and possible criminal detention. \n \n From seat 41A. Image: weibo \n \n It is not known if the passenger seated in seat 41A will face charges or be blacklisted from air-travel. \n \n This incident is the latest in a spate of plane passenger drama. In January last year, two Chinese passengers decided to open a plane's emergency exit doors in protest of flight delays. The act landed the both of them in prison. \n \n A man onboard a KLM flight was also arrested last September when he mistook the plane's exit door for a toilet door. \n \n Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nYou'd think bright red lettering would be enough for a passenger to distinguish a plane's emergency exit from a bathroom door—not to mention the window offering a clear view outside. Yet a first-time air traveler in China says she mistook a cabin door for the entrance to a toilet on a China Southern Airlines flight on Friday, causing an emergency slide to deploy, reports Mashable. Thankfully the flight to Shenzhen was still grounded at Chongqing Airport, where it had to remain for two hours. Passengers who were removed from the flight say a loud hissing noise could be heard when the 50-year-old touched the emergency door's handle. The woman later told officials that she had wanted to avoid the line for the bathroom and thought the door led to another toilet. An investigation is ongoing, but the woman didn't return to the plane, reports Shanghaiist. A man opened an emergency exit on a China Southern Airlines flight at the same airport earlier this month, per Mashable. His excuse: he wanted fresh air.\n#END SUMMARY"}

The FAA notified law enforcement and is investigating. \n \n Pointing a laser at a plane is a federal crime. The light can be disorienting for pilots approaching an airport. The number of reported laser incidents was up to nearly 2,000 through May 15, a record pace. \n \n Pilots of 12 different planes reported laser sightings on Wednesday and four more pilots reported sightings on Thursday over New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \n \n Fox News Channel's Laura Ingle contributed to this report ||||| 1.

United Express 5898, Toronto to Newark, was illuminated by a green laser struck left side of aircraft at 10:16 p.m. \n \n \n \n 6. United Airlines 1933, Houston to Newark, was illuminated for about 3 seconds about 7 miles southwest of Newark, at 11:35 p.m. \n \n At least six more flights over New York and New Jersey reported being illuminated by lasers Tuesday night, making 22 such incidents in recent weeks.In this recent rash of hits, six planes reported laser strikes including United Flight 1933 on approach to Newark.\"1933, we just got lasered from our 10 o'clock position,\" a pilot said.The FAA notified law enforcement about the reports, and the FAA is investigating. Below are the details on each flight:Like the previous rash of strikes, these laser hits were spread out from Newark to Warwick in Orange County, New York to LaGuardia in Queens. Twelve pilots reported spotting lasers Wednesday night, followed by at least another four pilots while flying over New Jersey and Pennsylvania Thursday night.\"We're they pointing it at you?\" the tower asked\"Directly pointing right at us. I saw the flash to left and out my head down,\" the pilot said.But as we reported in an investigation last year, laser strikes have plagued pilots flying in and out of our major airports ever since the hand-held devices became cheap and easy to get and much more powerful.They are able to ignite a pack of matches and shine blinding light miles into the sky.\"You have this searing intensity, this bright light shining into the aircraft, so you experience flash blindness,\" said Captain Hamilton, a commercial pilot.Captain Robert Hamilton knows first-hand the power and the danger of lasers.\"What goes through your mind is, 'Will I be able to complete the flight?'\" Hamilton said.FAA Data show about 4,000 laser strikes reported by pilots every year for past five years nationwide.Our research of government records has found numerous accounts of pilots reporting blurred vision, temporary blindness even retinal damage due to lasers.One passenger made clear what he thought about anyone thinking it's all a harmless game.\"Idiots on the ground who want to play with toys hopefully someone will find them and lock them up,\" said John Andersen, of West Haven, Connecticut.Newark had 28 reported laser-pointing incidents last year.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAuthorities appear no closer to figuring out the source of those mysterious lasers dazzling pilots over New Jersey and New York even as more incidents are recorded. After pilots reported lasers hitting at least 11 planes last week, nine more flights have been affected, including four last night. Two of the flights were a few miles west of Warwick, NY, one was 20 miles south of Newark Liberty International, and one was 20 miles southwest of LaGuardia, reports WABC. All were under 7,500 feet. Fox News reports laser incidents have been popping up at \"a record pace\" this year with almost 2,000 as of May 15.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nPolice fatally shot a woman in Austin, Texas early Sunday after her husband placed a mental health call because he was worried about his wife's behavior. \n \n Austin Assistant Police Chief Troy Gay told reporters that officers were told the woman was behaving erratically and had a weapon.

Austin police have opened an official investigation into the incident. \n \n This is the eighth fatal officer-involved shooting in Austin this year, according to KXAN. ||||| AUSTIN (KXAN) — A mental health call involving a woman who had a gun turned deadly early Sunday morning. \n \n It happened just before 4 a.m. at the Club at Summer Valley Apartments at 744 W. William Cannon, at the corner of South 1st Street. Austin police say they were originally called to the apartment complex for a husband who called stating his wife had a weapon. \n \n When the officers arrived and started assessing the situation, a white woman came out of the breezeway. Asst. Chief Troy Gay says the woman had a weapon in her hands and “extended the weapon towards the officers and said ‘shoot me, shoot me, kill me.'” \n \n Gay says officers gave her verbal commands to drop the weapon but she proceeded to move towards the officers, and they in turn fired their weapons. As she was lying on the ground, police say she was still moving after being shot and she still “had the weapon in her hand pointing at the direction of the officers.” Fearing they were still in danger, Gay says the officers fired several more shots. \n \n “The weapon was then away from the female and officers were able to have the weapon in their possession,” explains Gay in a news conference. \n \n The 26-year-old woman was taken to the hospital where she died a short time later. Two officers were involved in the shooting, both have been with the department for three years. They will be placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, which is standard protocol. \n \n This is the eighth deadly shooting involving Austin Police Department officers this year. The most recent was on Sept. 15 in southwest Austin. Police say Morgan Wayne Crocker, 34, was shot and killed during a burglary call. When officers arrived the second time, they saw Crocker trying to run away from the apartment complex. In order to get him to stop, one officer used a stun gun on the suspect, but he rolled over on the ground and when he rolled over, police say he took out a weapon and shot at one of the officers. The officers shot back and wounded the man but police say he continued to resist after being shot. He died at the hospital. \n \n In April, police say the deadly shooting of a man wielding knives in a store parking lot appeared to be “suicide by cop”—which could be the situation in Sunday’s shooting.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPolice in Texas shot and killed a woman after responding to a mental health call, NBC News reports.

The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThis election season has been surprising for any number of reasons, from Russia’s alleged cyber-intervention that tipped the scales toward its favorite useful idiot to the shock victory of a former reality-TV show host who was caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women with impunity. It’s also resulted in some far-fetched alliances: Hillary Clinton and Mary J. Blige (cringe), Mitt Romney and Donald Trump (sad!), and Kanye and Donald (ugh). \n \n Enter: Samantha Bee and Glenn Beck. \n \n Five years ago, around the time Beck’s views were considered too far-right for even Fox News, this union would seem—in the immortal words of Vizzini—inconceivable, yet in recent months, Beck has experienced a Scrooge-like transformation. He’s penned a New York Times op-ed in support of Black Lives Matter; branded Trump “under-educated” and a “danger to the republic”; and came out against Steve Bannon and the “alt-right,” calling the ex-Breitbart puppeteer-turned-Trump chief strategist a “terrifying man” with a “clear tie to white nationalists.” Whether or not this is a calculated move on Beck’s part given his cratering media empire is anyone’s guess. \n \n On Monday night, Bee welcomed Beck on her late-night program Full Frontal for a Christmastime chat. Dressed in matching ugly Christmas sweaters, the disparate duo first exchanged a few pleasantries. “My audience would like to stab you relentlessly in the eye,” said Beck. “My audience wants to kill me for normalizing a lunatic like yourself,” Bee replied. \n \n The comedienne then explained why she decided to reach out to Beck and have him on her program. “I think that our future is going to require a broad coalition of nonpartisan decency. It’s not just individual people against Donald Trump; it’s all of us against Trumpism,” she offered.“I agree,” said Beck. “As a guy who has done damage, I don’t want to do any more damage. I know what I did. I helped divide—I’m willing to take that. My message to you is: Please don’t make the mistakes I made. And I think all of us are doing it. We’re doing it on Facebook, we’re doing it on Twitter. We tear each other apart and we don’t see the human on the other side.” \n \n Beck then took Bee to task for adopting “a lot of my catastrophe traits,” insinuating that she, like many of her fellow left-leaning political satirists, has a tendency to overstate the direness of things, turning the volume up to 11 on even the most minor transgressions. \n \n “Do you believe there’s a chance we fall into a dictatorship under Donald Trump?” asked Beck. “Do you believe there’s a chance we lose our freedom of speech and press under this president?” \n \n At the conclusion of their surreal tête-à-tête, they held hands (“It feels so creepy,” joked Beck), before Bee gifted Beck with a ‘Strange Bedfellows’ cake of them lying together in bed. Then, they ate each other’s cake heads, because that’s what odd friendship tastes like. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded. \n \n Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n \n This feature is not available right now.

On Full Frontal, conservative pundit Glenn Beck joined host Samantha Bee, whom he greeted with, \"My audience would like to stab you relentlessly in the eye,\" which Bee countered with: \"My audience wants to kill me for normalizing a lunatic like yourself.\" But the meeting then took a more conciliatory turn, with Bee noting, \"Our future is going to require a broad coalition of non-partisan decency. It's not just individual people against Donald Trump, it's all of us against Trumpism.\" Beck agreed, admitting culpability \"as a guy who has done damage\" in the past and sending a message out to the audience: \"Please don't make the mistakes that I made.\" Watch the clip above to see their conversation, as well as some \"creepy\" skin-touching. (Beck also has things to say about Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTim Tebow is joining “GMA” as a contributor \n \n The Heisman winner, who currently works as an analyst for ESPN’s SEC Network, becomes the latest person from the sports world to join “Good Morning America.” He’ll debut on Monday. \n \n \n \n “Legends of Korra” will be back in October \n \n The Nickelodeon series just ended its 3rd season two weeks ago.

Pepperidge Farm sued Trader Joe's for trademark infringement over a cookie product it says closely resembles Milano. (Photo: Pepperidge Farm) \n \n A line of cookies sold at Trader Joe's looks a little too familiar to Pepperidge Farm. \n \n Pepperidge Farm, a division of Campbell Soup, sued the popular grocery chain for trademark infringement over a product called Crispy Cookies that it says too closely resembles both the look and package design of Pepperidge Farm's iconic Milano cookies — a line of oval-shaped sandwich cookies with chocolate filling.

Pepperidge Farm claims the grocery chain's Crispy Cookies are too similar to its Milano cookies, which it started selling in 1956 and registered a trademark for in 2010, Reuters reports. \"Trader Joe’s has willfully sought to trade on Pepperidge Farm’s reputation and the reputation of the Milano cookies,\" USA Today quotes the complaint filed Wednesday in Connecticut. For those not in the know, Milano cookies are two oval-shaped cookies with layer of chocolate or some other flavor sandwiched in between. Pepperidge Farm claims it has made \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" on Milano cookies in the past decade alone and that Trader Joe's is \"diluting the value\" of the cookie. Pepperidge Farm accuses Trader Joe's of intentionally confusing cookie buyers, and it's that violation of trust that hurts the most, Reuters reports. \"The trust Pepperidge Farm has built with consumers is of utmost importance to us,\" a spokesperson says. The complaint acknowledges that Trader Joe's Crispy Cookies are more of a rectangle, but notes they have rounded edges that make them at least oval-ish and come in similar packaging. \"The acts of Trader Joe's have been malicious and calculated to injure Pepperidge Farm,\" the complaint states. The company wants Trader Joe's to stop selling its copycat cookies and pay damages. According to USA Today, Pepperidge Farm first notified Trader Joe's of the potential trademark infringement in August. Remember when you swiped a popular cookie design from a litigious treat purveyor? Pepperidge Farm remembers.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nmassive hemoptysis is a life - threatening pulmonary emergency and has a variety of underlying conditions . \n transcatheter bronchial artery embolization ( bae ) is a well - established and effective non - surgical procedure for the management of massive hemoptysis ( 1 ) . \n recently, non - bronchial systemic arteries have been reported as an important source of bleeding with massive hemoptysis . computed tomography ( ct ) and computed tomography angiography ( cta ) \n we herein report a rare case of massive hemoptysis in a patient with focal bronchiectasis and right inferior phrenic artery - to - right pulmonary artery fistula diagnosed by ct and cta . \n an 82-year - old woman was transferred to our hospital because of dyspnea and massive hemoptysis . the patient had a history of bronchial asthma that was well - controlled with bronchodilator medications . \n she suffered from severe hypoxemia ( ph 7.362, pco2 35.1 mmhg, po2 61.0 mmhg, hco3 20.1 mmhg, be -5.5 mmhg, spo2 90.5%, under 10 l o2/min, reservoir mask ) . \n a chest ct further demonstrated multiple consolidations and ground glass opacity and focal bronchiectasis in right segment 4 ( s4 ) ( fig . \n since there was no active hemorrhaging from the tracheal tube, she was then extubated . \n computed tomography showed multiple consolidation and ground glass opacities . to determine the origin of bleeding, she underwent contrast - enhanced ct, which showed bronchiectasis in right s4 and regression of the infiltration . \n cta revealed an abnormal vascular anastomosis between the right inferior phrenic artery and right pulmonary artery beside the focal bronchiectasis at the right middle lobe ( fig . \n 3 ), which led us to suspect it as the possible source of the massive hemoptysis . \n three weeks after the embolization, she was successfully discharged and has been free from recurrent hemoptysis for three years . a : a high - resolution computed tomography ( ct ) image showing focal bronchiectasis in the right middle lung ( s4 ) . \n b : ct angiography showing a vessel entering the bronchiectasis lesion arising from the right inferior phrenic artery . \n c : three - dimensional ct depicting the right inferior phrenic artery - to - right pulmonary artery fistula . \n right inferior phrenic artery angiogram confirmed the right inferior phrenic artery - to - right pulmonary artery fistula ( arrow ) in an intrapulmonary portion . \n the present case report describes an elderly woman who had right inferior phrenic artery - to - pulmonary artery fistula with focal bronchiectasis leading to life - threatening hemoptysis . \n however, recurrent hemoptysis after successful bae is not rare, and non - bronchial arteries can function as sources of bleeding in some cases ( 3 ) . in the present case, \n we planned bae to prevent recurrent hemoptysis and performed high - resolution ct and cta before bae . \n cta revealed the right inferior phrenic artery - to - pulmonary artery fistula, not the bronchial arteries, as the source of the bleeding . \n the bronchial arteries are responsible for bleeding in more than 90% of cases with massive hemoptysis . in the remaining 10% of cases, \n the internal mammary, intercostal, and inferior phrenic artery are typically involved in hemoptysis ( 3,4 ) . in most of the reported cases of inferior phrenic artery origin \n, the lower lobe of the lung was affected with chronic inflammation and found to be the site of bleeding ( 5 - 8 ) . \n transpleural systemic - pulmonary artery anastomoses may develop in patients with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, or chronic pneumonia ( 5 ) . in the present case, \n a right inferior phrenic artery - to - right pulmonary artery fistula was the origin of bleeding in the right middle lobe, instead of the lower lobe . \n the present paper demonstrates that, for effective bae in patients with massive hemoptysis, ct and cta should be performed beforehand to precisely identify the culprit lesion for bleeding .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nMassive hemoptysis is a medical emergency and needs immediate treatment . \n it occurs in a wide variety of pulmonary diseases and typically originates from the bronchial arteries . \n we herein report a very rare case of a patient bleeding from a right phrenic artery - to - pulmonary artery fistula accompanied with focal bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe of the lung . in this case, \n multi - detector computed tomography was useful for clarifying the etiology and the abnormal anastomosis and facilitated effective angiographic embolization .\n#END SUMMARY"}

They ask for a taxi ride, and when you arrive there is a thief waiting to rob you. Sometimes our companions don't want to hand over the motorcycle and they shoot them in the legs or they kill them.\" \n \n Bikers are prime targets because they zip en masse around the South American country's choked roads every day, added Montaño, who said the federation has millions of members. \n \n He had no national statistics on hand, but said some 17 people have been murdered for their motorbikes in his home state of Vargas this year alone. \n \n Venezuela's Interior Ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. \n \n Amid a tumble in oil prices, the cash-strapped OPEC member has prioritized food imports and debt servicing, leaving less hard currency for other purchases. \n \n Montaño said he was calling on President Nicolas Maduro to put the federation in charge of importing spare parts from China to prevent a further escalation of crime and alleviate the shortages. \n \n Fellow bikers echoed his worries, with one saying he was now heading home early and paying particular attention at red lights where holdups are common. \n \n \"The situation is worsening,\" said another biker from the west side of Caracas who was held up at gunpoint for his vehicle. \"You live life minute-to-minute.\" (Reporting by Corina Pons and Alexandra Ulmer, editing by G Crosse) ||||| And a United States Treasury Department investigation made public in March uncovered a money laundering ring that had moved $4.2 billion out of Venezuela though import-related schemes and other means. The investigators determined that at least $50 million had passed through the American financial system. \n \n Mr. Maduro, a leftist president who was elected by a narrow margin in 2013, has often come under pressure to attack government corruption. \n \n In December 2013, Mr. Maduro appointed the commission to investigate the import ploys, calling them “a fraud against the republic.” \n \n “I am going to reveal to the country the truth about what happened there, because it was a vulgarity,” Mr. Maduro said. \n \n Jesús Faría, a member of the commission and a governing party lawmaker, said in a television interview last month that in just a sampling of cases, the commission had found that more than 250 companies “had broken the law and that the prosecutor’s office had hundreds of companies to evaluate and investigate.” \n \n “Nevertheless, I have not seen that any of these companies have been punished,” he added. \n \n There appears to be only one criminal case in which prosecutors have charged a high-level official at the currency control agency with wrongdoing. \n \n The official, Francisco Navas, was arrested in 2013 and has yet to stand trial. He is charged with money laundering and conspiracy, accused of taking bribes to sign off on millions of dollars of payments to companies for bogus imports. According to the testimony of an agency vice president, Mr. Navas charged companies the equivalent of about 46 cents for each dollar he approved. \n \n His lawyer, Alonso Medina, said that Mr. Navas was a scapegoat, charged so that the authorities had someone to “hold responsible before public opinion.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nVenezuela is running low on motorcycle parts, which is, in turn, likely only making its coffin shortage worse. Motorcycle riders are being gunned down for their bikes as a recession wreaks havoc on the South American country, reports Reuters. \"They're killing those of us in the street to steal our bike because there are no bikes or spare parts,\" says Jorge Montaño, the leader of the country's National Socialist Federation of Motorbikers, which is said to have millions of members. He explains \"well-dressed women\" request a motorcycle taxi ride to a destination where a thief is waiting to steal the bike from its owner. \"Sometimes our companions don't want to hand over the motorcycle and they shoot them in the legs or they kill them,\" he says. Montaño notes at least 17 people have been killed for their motorbikes in the state of Vargas so far this year. Some riders now say they don't stay out on their bikes late at night and are extra vigilant when stopped at red lights. \"The situation is worsening,\" says a biker from Caracas, who was previously held up at gunpoint for his motorcycle. \"You live life minute-to-minute.\" Though food imports and debt servicing are now the priority in Venezuela, Montaño hopes to press President Nicolas Maduro to import spare motorcycle parts from China in the hopes of cutting down on violence.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| JUNEAU - \n \n UPDATE: The Department of Fish and Game has reconsidered its decision to kill the five bears that frequent Government Hill, officials wrote in a press release, Saturday evening. \n \n \"After receiving waves of requests from the public to spare the sow and her four yearling cubs, Gov. Bill Walker and the department made a collective decision today to instead relocate the bears,\" officials wrote. \n \n According to the release, relocating bears has not always been a good option. A trash-eating bear that was killed last year on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, had previously been relocated to a remote area near Eklutna, though she returned to Anchorage with her cubs, shortly after. \n \n ORIGINAL STORY: A family of trash-eating bears that made headlines as they traipsed around Government Hill is getting a stay of execution from Alaska’s governor. \n \n \n \n Department of Fish and Game officials said earlier this week there was no choice but to kill the five black bears that have been wandering around the Anchorage neighborhood due to the cost involved with relocation, potential diseases that may result, and the complexities of finding a welcoming home. \n \n \n \n However, Gov. Bill Walker said Saturday from the Capitol — amid the frenetic close to the 90-day lawmaking session — that he found a minute to contact Fish and Game Commissioner Sam Cotten to instruct them to take another approach. \n \n Walker said he was concerned when he saw news reports that the bears could be put down. \n \n \n \n “I've been following it, watching it,” he said. “I just think this is the season that we can give them another try elsewhere. I really didn’t think the bears had done anything wrong.” \n \n \n \n Grace Jang, the governor’s spokeswoman, said the department will make another attempt to relocate the animals but will keep public safety as the top priority. \n \n Fish and Game officials previously said the city needs to deal with its garbage problem to prevent future incidents where bears are put down due to public safety concerns. \n \n \n \n Residential areas known to be frequented by bears often have no bear-proof trash cans: “If we can deal with the bear garbage attraction situation properly, they’ll still be around but you won’t see them as much,” said Sean Farley, a research biologist. \n \n \n \n WATCH: Gov. Bill Walker talks about his decision outside of his Juneau office\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA female black bear and four yearling cubs who have been making a living Dumpster diving in Anchorage will get a new home—and not that great trout stream in the sky, thanks in part to the actions of Alaska Gov. Bill Walker. As the Alaska Dispatch News reports, Walker yesterday intervened to plead for the lives of the quintet, which were set to be euthanized, by asking the state Fish and Game commissioner if there was another solution. \"I’m sure there will be plenty of criticism about the governor getting involved in this,\" Walker said. \"But I’m a person too. I have a soft spot for individuals in circumstances not of their own making.\" The bears will now likely be trapped and transported about 60 miles away, so as to inhibit their return. \"I'm here in Juneau being inundated with budget issues and having to say no to all these programs,\" Walker continues. \"I felt these bears had done nothing wrong and just thought it was the right thing to do.\" Speaking of those budget issues, the Fish and Game chief says it won't be too pricey to move the bears—but don't expect relocation to replace euthanasia as the norm. \"There are a lot of bears so it would be expensive if you had somebody doing it full time,\" he says. Both men underscore that it was a request from Walker that resulted in \"a collective decision,\" per KTUU, not an order.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nINDIO, CA - Trial proceedings were expected to get underway starting Monday for an Indio man accused of murdering his girlfriend and dumping her body at an Indio golf course. \n \n Michael John Franco, 45, faces life without the possibility of parole for the alleged murder of Jill Grant, 41, a popular Palm Desert High School math teacher whose body was found at the Golf Club at Terra Lago in the early morning hours of Dec. 23, 2013. \n \n In addition to murder, Franco faces special circumstance allegations of inflicting torture on Grant and committing the murder in the commission of a felony, initially making him eligible for the death penalty. In August 2015, prosecutors decided not to pursue capital punishment against him. \n \n Franco also faces one felony count each of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm, and sentence-enhancing allegations of using a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. \n \n Grant's body was found by golf course employees, who told Indio police that an SUV sped off from the scene, leaving tire marks along the course. \n \n Grant was found with numerous injuries; the criminal complaint lists a Toyota Prius and a box cutter as weapons used in the killing. \n \n Investigators said a search conducted the following day at Grant's residence in the 84-400 block of Onda Drive in Indio revealed blood on several items throughout the house and shoe prints consistent with impressions found at the crime scene, according to court records. \n \n Franco was taken into custody on Dec. 24, 2013 in Palm Desert. Police said in court documents that Franco had to be Tased before being taken into custody following \"a short scuffle\" and told police that he was trying to get to Mexico before they caught him. \n \n Franco remains held in lieu of $5 million bail. \n \n According to the criminal complaint, he was convicted of felony robbery in Alameda County in June 1990, but has no felony convictions in Riverside County. \n \n - City News Service / Image via Shutterstock ||||| Indio Police Department \n \n Indio Police Department \n \n INDIO, Calif. - A 44-year-old ex-con pleaded not guilty Thursday to murdering his girlfriend, a Coachella Valley native and popular Palm Desert High School math teacher. \n \n The body of Jill Grant, 41, was discovered in a dirt area near Golf Center Parkway and Avenue 42 in Indio on Dec. 23, 2013, and Michael John Franco of Indio was arrested in Palm Desert the following day. \n \n In addition to murder, Franco faces one felony count each of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm, and sentence-enhancing allegations of using a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. \n \n He is scheduled to return to court for a trial-readiness conference on Feb. 2. \n \n Franco, who's being held in lieu of $5 million bail, was ordered to stand trial on Dec 3. \n \n Investigators found evidence at Grant's residence in the 84400 block of Onda Drive in Indio that linked her boyfriend to her death, an Indio Police Department spokesman alleged at the time of the defendant's arrest. \n \n Grant suffered multiple injuries; the criminal complaint lists a Toyota Prius and a box cutter as weapons used in the killing. \n \n Sherry Johnstone, assistant superintendent for personnel at the Desert Sands Unified School District, said in 2013 that Grant was ``a beloved teacher and part of the Desert Sands family for many years.'' \n \n ``We are grief-stricken -- students, faculty, staff ... Everyone loved Jill and this is a horrible tragedy,'' she said. \n \n Grant grew up in the Santa Rosa Mountains above Palm Springs and attended Palm Desert Middle School and Palm Desert High School, graduating in 1990. She attended College of the Desert, then transferred to Cal State San Bernardino, where she majored in mathematics. \n \n She taught math at Palm Springs High School for three years, starting in 1995, then began teaching at her alma mater in 1998. \n \n According to the criminal complaint, Franco was convicted of felony robbery in Alameda County in June 1990.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nJill Grant and her boyfriend Michael Franco had planned to throw a party on Dec. 23, 2013. But when guests showed up to their gated neighborhood in Indio, Calif., they couldn't get in, and Franco told them the party was off. Grant's brother called police—who by that time had already recovered Grant's body. Prosecutors say Franco killed the 41-year-old high school math teacher, and the Desert Sun now reports that an inadvertent voicemail may have captured the final desperate moments of her life. Prosecutors allege Franco first cut his girlfriend's throat, then ran her over with a car and deposited her body at a nearby golf course; KESQ reports a box cutter and Toyota Prius are listed as the weapons used in the criminal complaint. The voicemail in question is one left by Franco's phone to a friend's number in an apparent butt dial, per court documents. Though the Desert Sun reports it's largely inaudible, Grant is heard saying this: \"What if I drive the car someplace and call [911] myself and say I was attacked? Would that work? But we can think of something to say like (inaudible) ... What do you want me to say?\" Among the other alleged evidence against Franco, who has pleaded not guilty: Franco took money out of an ATM using Grant's card on the night of her death, and when apprehended by police reportedly told them he was trying to flee to Mexico. A cell mate claims Franco confessed to him, saying Franco said he ran her over when she tried to get away from him. Palm Desert Patch reports he faces life without parole. (This man died after his 911 call was dismissed as a butt dial.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Young was 18 at the time. They were both students at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. \"I hate to have that on my plate. But that's rape.\" \n \n Now 20, Young pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child. He could have spent up to twenty years in prison. But instead, Dallas County District Judge Jeanine Howard decided to give him a nice break during his sentencing last week. \n \n Young will spend a short stint of just 45 days in jail, Judge Howard ruled. And when he's out, the sentence says, \"the defendant is to start 250 hours of Community Service at the Rape Crisis Center.\" \n \n Oh no he won't, says the rape crisis center. Apparently, rape victims don't like turning to rapists in times of crisis. \n \n \"We all read it [the sentence] and we're like, wait a minute,\" Bobbie Villareal, Executive Director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, tells Unfair Park. \n \n The center accepts volunteers, but not people completing community service hours. Volunteers all have to undergo a criminal background check. \"You cannot in any form or fashion have anything on your record,\" Villareal says. \"The fact that she would order 250 hours at a rape crisis center just surprised us.\" \n \n Curious, Villareal has been waiting to see if Young ever calls the center about completing his community service there. (If the call comes in, the answer is still no). \n \n The only other rape crisis center in Dallas is at Parkland. And they don't use any volunteers at all, a hospital spokesman tells Unfair Park. \n \n It seems then that Young has little chance of spending 250 hours assisting rape victims. Informed of this, the judge's court coordinator told Unfair Park that she'll change the sentence slightly. \"She's going go back and modify those conditions and give him community service hours somewhere else, but she hasn't determined where yet,\" Court Coordinator Jerry Barker says. The judge's office otherwise declined to comment on the sentence. \n \n Hopefully, the new volunteer spot will not be a place involves direct contact with sexual assault victims or children. ||||| Rape crisis center scolds Texas judge after she sentences rapist to work with victims there \n \n By David Edwards \n \n Thursday, May 1, 2014 11:39 EDT \n \n A Texas judge who ordered a rapist to serve community service at a rape crisis center has been forced to reconsider the sentence. \n \n In a police interview, Sir Young admitted that he had raped a 14-year-old girl in 2011 at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts when he was 18. \n \n “I hate to have that on my plate. But that’s rape,” he told police. \n \n According to The Dallas Observer, Young could have served 20 years in jail, but Dallas County District Judge Jeanine Howard showed him leniency during last week’s sentencing. \n \n Howard ruled that Young would only have to spend 45 days in jail, but it was the “250 hours of community service at a rape crisis center” that shocked victim advocates. \n \n “I’m sure she probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps,” Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center Executive Director Bobbie Villareal told WFAA. “But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision,” \n \n “There’s just so many problems with that,” she pointed out. “First of all, we would worry about our client safety and well-being, the appropriateness of them having any kind of contact with survivors — even if it was a past victimization. Just having a criminal defendant in the office could be a triggering effect for many of our clients.” \n \n So when the probation office called to arrange Young’s community service, Villareal answered with a firm “no.” \n \n “[We] had a really nice conversation with them, but told them — first of all — that we have a strict policy on our volunteers,” she explained. “They can have no criminal backgrounds whatsoever.” \n \n Jerry Barker, the court coordinator, said that Judge Howard would find another place for Young to serve out his sentence. \n \n “The judge and the probation department are modifying his conditions,” Barker told WFAA. “They’re working on it right now. They’re going to come up with a different order for him to do his community service somewhere else.” \n \n Villareal noted that the rest of Howard’s sentence was also an insult to rape survivors. \n \n “It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down,” Villareal observed. “It sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault.” \n \n Judge Howard has refused to comment while the case was still pending. \n \n Watch the video below from WFAA, broadcast April 30, 2014.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nDallas County District Judge Jeanine Howard is known for handing out unusual sentences, but her latest \"shocked and disturbed,\" reports WFAA. Sir Young, 20, pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old girl at Booker T. Washington High School; he was an 18-year-old student there at the time. He faced 20 years behind bars, but was last week handed 45 days in jail and an order to do 250 hours of community service ... at a rape crisis center. Outcry ensued, with the executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center calling the decision inappropriate. Bobbie Villareal told the probation department as much on Tuesday when it called to ask if Young could complete his required hours there. Setting aside the fact that the clinic's volunteers aren't permitted to have criminal backgrounds, \"we would worry about our client safety and well-being, the appropriateness of (Young) having any kind of contact with survivors,\" says Villareal. Now, the judge and the department are \"modifying his conditions\" so that Young logs the hours elsewhere, a rep for the court tells the Dallas Observer. But WFAA points out another part of his sentence is drawing complaints: five years of deferred adjudication; that's a kind of probation that will result in his case essentially being dismissed if he completes the requirements of his sentence. (Another rape case is grabbing headlines for much the same reason.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nCHILDREN have been left screaming in terror after a fighter jet plunged from the sky, bursting into flames during a military airshow. \n \n Families watched on in horror as the jet ditched towards earth, sending a huge plume of flames and smoke into the air while performing stunts for the crowd. \n \n Pongsiri Thammaroekrit 5 The fighter jet went up in flames after crashing during an aerial show in Thailand \n \n The pilot, 34-year-old Group Captain Dilokrit Pattavee was killed in the crash, which happened in the southern city of Hat Yai during Thailand’s annual Children’s Day celebrations. \n \n It is understood that theRoyal Thai Air Force pilot was performing stunts in a Swedish-made JAS 39 Gripen jet when it crashed on Saturday morning. \n \n Defence ministry spokesman Major General Kongcheep Tantravanich told AFP: “One pilot was killed in the accident this morning.” \n \n Pongsiri Thammaroekrit 5 Hundreds of spectators screamed as a plume of smoke rose into the air \n \n Pongsiri Thammaroekrit 5 The jet, a Swedish-made 39C Gripen, was performing stunts for the Children’s Day \n \n SWNS:South West News Service 5 Group Captain Dilokrit Pattavee was killed in the crash during the Children’s Day air show \n \n Hundreds of people had gathered to see the aerial show on Saturday. \n \n In a video of the crash, the crowds can be heard screaming when flames are sent shooting into the air. \n \n Fire crews rushed to the site with flights diverted to the nearby Krabi airport. \n \n Stunned onlooker Penwipha Thuanthong said: ”It was scary.

Check Craigslist. Fans of Achatz' brand of avant-garde cooking are literally paying thousands of dollars for the privilege of eating at his newest outpost. The restaurant operates on a ticket system -- secure a ticket and you're in for a meal. But demand drives up prices, and since the seats are limited, scalpers are having a field day. Recent Craigslist postings have the coveted tickets listed for as much as $3,000 . Achatz proved his cooking chops at Alinea, but he's going to have to put out some pretty impressive food to satisfy diners who ponied up that much dough. Read the full story at The Huffington Post. ||||| Just a day after tickets to Grant Achatz’s new restaurant, Next, went on sale, tickets have popped up on Craigslist starting at $575. That low, low price gets buyers two seats at a four-top table with two other strangers. But, hey, there are wine pairings. \n \n Really big spenders might be more interested in dining at the restaurant’s chef’s table, which features a 16-course meal for six people, including wine pairings. Face value on the tickets—including tip—is $165 per person. Craigslist price? $3,000. \n \n Most tickets are going for $800 to $1000 for two diners, and include the confirmation e-mail the original purchasers received. Of course, that’s not to say some sleazy ticket broker didn’t make up a fake e-mail address, buy tickets, and then sell them 30 times under a fake name—but, hey, that’s the risk buyers take, right? \n \n For its part, Next is kind of shirking responsibility. Co-owner Nick Kokonas told Eater, “We cannot help ticket re-sales any more than the Cubs.” True, but do Next’s confirmation e-mails have holograms on them? Maybe that’s something to look into on the menu’s next iteration—Bangkok 2312, anyone? \n \n Editor's note: Kokonas commented on this article (see below) and noted that, \"Actually, the entirety of my comment to them was that we do not want scalping, that we require confirmation of BOTH parties – buyer beware -– and that we will not honor tickets that have not confirmed the sale with us. THEN I said that I wish I could stop it but we cannot legally do so any more than the Cubs. The tickets are required to be transferable by law for face value. We are not shirking responsibility -- we are trying hard to ensure that the tickets are real, which is all we can do. When we can send holograms by email, let me know.\" Fair enough, Nick. Thanks for commenting! ||||| Having trouble getting tickets to Grant Achatz's new Chicago restaurant, Next? You could try Craigslist, where there's a hot black market trade in tables going on. Of course, you'll end up paying a lot more than if you just went through the restaurant, but hey! Grant Achatz doesn't open a new restaurant every day. \n \n The official prices for Next vary depending on what time you make your reservation, but are around $85 per person for the current menu (plus wine, tax and gratuity). The resale prices, on the other hand, can be anywhere from a $500 mystery reservation to a $3,000 ticket for six to the \"kitchen table,\" which features an expanded 16 course meal. The average ticket seems to hover around $1,000 for a table for two. ||||| Grant Achatz's Next Restaurant just opened and already tickets have popped up on Craigslist and eBay, selling from $500 to $3000. Co-owner Nick Kokonas told Eater Chicago that he was \"surprised how quickly\" tickets showed up. \n \n We're not. For those lucky enough to score reservations, certainly some of them must have had the intention to re-sell their tickets all along, especially with the potentially high profit margins. The crop of Craigslist tickets range in perceived value, as some include wine pairings, while the $3000 ticket advertises the much-coveted chef's table. Original ticket prices are as low (relatively speaking) as $85 per person. (This whole secondary market for Next tickets makes us wonder: does food taste better when you know you'll never be able to have it again?) \n \n The jury is out on whether this ticketing system will be a successful reservation concept, even for such a high-demand, rotating-concept restaurant (read more about the concept here, here, here and here). With tickets selling for such high prices, the process currently seems to favor those who are willing and able to spend top dollar to secure a seat. Kokonas tells the AV Club that they are not encouraging scalping and Next requires the confirmation of both parties of any ticket transfers. \"I wish I could stop it but we cannot legally do so any more than the Cubs,\" he says. \n \n Clearly hearing it from those who sense their chances of enjoying the 3-month Escoffier run at Next dwindling, Achatz echoed this same messaging over Twitter on Friday: \n \n So, just think of Next as sort of a perpetual World Series! Games every night, new teams every three months.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWant to eat at Next, the highly anticipated new restaurant from top Chicago chef Grant Achatz? Then expect to pay quite a bit for the experience. Unless you can snag your own ticket (which isn't cheap at $85 per person), a ticket bought on Craigslist or eBay will set you back $500 to $3,000, Slashfood notes. The difference in prices for the scalped tickets can be explained by what options they include, the Huffington Post reports: Some include wine pairings, while the most expensive are at the chef's table. Eater notes that the average ticket price seems to be around $1,000 for a two-person table. Co-owner Nick Kokonas tells the AV Club the restaurant doesn't encourage scalping and adds, \"I wish I could stop it but we cannot legally do so any more than the Cubs.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

d : systole ) revealed typical left ventricular apical ballooning and an akinetic region that extended well beyond the vascular territory of the occluded vessel . \n although causality can not be conclusively inferred from this association, we believe that the somatic stress associated with ami may have caused tcm in this patient . \n thus, she can be considered to have been at increased risk of developing tcm . \n tcm is typically preceded by an acute somatic or emotional stressor and is believed to be caused by elevated levels of catecholamines . \n, among the somatic stressors known to be associated with tcm are intracranial events, severe infection, surgical trauma and respiratory disease . \n because a relationship has been described between tcm and many acute syndromes associated with increased somatic stress, it is intuitive to assume that ami, another acute condition associated with considerable somatic stress, could be associated with tcm . \n similar to other forms of severe somatic disease, ami is associated with increased levels of catecholamine . however, in ami, catecholamine is particularly high in the periinfarct zone . \n thus, if anything, ami would be expected to more frequently associate with tcm than other somatically stressful syndromes . \n we propose that tcm and ami may not be mutually exclusive conditions, and that they may be intertwined in ways we have yet to discover . \n if this is true, developing strategies for reversing takotsubo may improve the outcome in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock secondary to ami . \n recent evidence indicates that takotsubo is a cardiocirculatory syndrome that associates with low peripheral resistance and low blood pressure despite adequate tissue perfusion . in other words, patients with tcm display a different cardiocirculatory profile compared to patients with only ami . \n because standard acute heart failure therapy with vasopressors and/or inotropes may be directly harmful in tcm, clinicians would probably do well to withhold these therapies in hypotensive patients with tcm that do not display signs of tissue hypoperfusion . because optimal treatment of hypotensive patients may depend on whether or not ami is complicated by tcm \n if echocardiography had not been performed in this patient immediately on admission, we believe that this patient may have been diagnosed with only myocardial infarction and the diagnosis of tcm may have been overlooked . \n it may be prudent to perform echocardiography without delay in patients presenting with acute chest pain and elevated troponins .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy ( tcm ) is an acute cardiac syndrome characterized by extensive, but potentially reversible, left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of an explanatory coronary obstruction . \n thus, tcm is distinct from coronary artery disease ( cad ) and acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) . \n however, substantial evidence for co - existing cad in some tcm patients exist . \n herein, we take this association one step further and present a case in which the patient simultaneously suffered from ami and tcm, and in which we believe that a primary coronary event triggered tcm . an 88-year - old female presented with chest pain . \n echocardiography revealed apical akinesia with hypercontractile bases . \n an occluded diagonal branch with suspected acute plaque rupture was identified on the angiogram, but could not explain the extent of akinesia . \n cardiac function recovered completely . \n thus, this patient adhered to current diagnostic criteria for tcm . \n tcm is a well - known complication for other conditions associated with somatic stress . \n it is therefore intuitive to assume that ami, which also associates with somatic stress and elevated catecholamine, can cause tcm . \n our case illustrates that tcm and ami may occur simultaneously . \n although causality can not be conclusively inferred from this association, the somatic stress associated with ami may have caused tcm in this patient .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\ntumours were initiated by intratracheal infection of mice with a lentiviral vector expressing cre -

mediated somatic activation of oncogenic kras and deletion of p53 in the lung epithelial cells of kraslsl - g12d/+;p53flox / flox mice initiates lung adenocarcinoma development4 . although tumours are initiated synchronously by defined genetic alterations, only a subset become malignant, suggesting that disease progression requires additional alterations . \n identification of the lentiviral integration sites allowed us to distinguish metastatic from non - metastatic tumours and determine the gene expression alterations that distinguish these tumour types . \n cross - species analysis identified the nk-2 related homeobox transcription factor nkx2 - 1 ( ttf-1/titf1 ) as a candidate suppressor of malignant progression . in this mouse model, \n nkx2 - 1-negativity is pathognomonic of high - grade poorly differentiated tumours . \n gain - and loss - of - function experiments in cells derived from metastatic and non - metastatic tumours demonstrated that nkx2 - 1 controls tumour differentiation and limits metastatic potential in vivo . \n interrogation of nkx2 - 1 regulated genes, analysis of tumours at defined developmental stages, and functional complementation experiments indicate that nkx2 - 1 constrains tumours in part by repressing the embryonically - restricted chromatin regulator hmga2 . \n while focal amplification of nkx2 - 1 in a fraction of human lung adenocarcinomas has focused attention on its oncogenic function69, our data specifically link nkx2 - 1 downregulation to loss of differentiation, enhanced tumour seeding ability, and increased metastatic proclivity . \n thus, the oncogenic and suppressive functions of nkx2 - 1 in the same tumour type substantiate its role as a dual function lineage factor .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA judge sentenced a Pico Rivera man to nearly 40 years in state prison for extorting 21 underage girls in eight states into sending him nude pictures online, authorities said. \n \n Cesar Mauricio Estrada-Davila, also known as Cesar Estrada, 20, pleaded “no contest” on Wednesday to 38 felony charges, including 21 counts of distributing or showing child pornography to a minor, 16 counts of possession of child pornography and one count of committing a lewd act on a child, Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office spokesman Ricardo Santiago said in a written statement. \n \n At his sentencing on Friday in the Antelope Valley branch of Los Angeles County Superior Court, Estrada received a prison term of 39 years and 8 months.

Cesar Mauricio Estrada-Davila, 20, pleaded no contest this week to 38 felony counts, including 16 counts of possessing child or youth pornography, and was sentenced to 39 years and 8 months, CBS reports. Prosecutors say that for several months in early 2015, Estrada-Davila reached out to young girls he found on social media websites. He told them he could make them famous and asked for photos of them in their underwear, then threatened to show the underwear photos to their families and friends if they didn't send him nude photos. Estrada-Davila was charged in connection with 21 victims between the ages of 12 and 17 in eight states. Police say he was arrested after a 14-year-old California girl told her father about his demands, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports. Cops searched his Los Angeles County home and found more than 26,000 pages of text and online conversations between him and his victims. Before a plea deal was worked out, Estrada-Davila faced more than 150 charges, enough to send him to prison for life several times over.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAn anonymous caller warned authorities Monday that his roommate was on his way to Yale University to shoot people, leading officials to lock the Ivy League campus down as police searched for a gunman. At least two witnesses reported seeing someone on or near campus with a long gun. \n \n An emergency call was received around 9:30 a.m. local time from a man at a pay phone about a mile (two kilometers) from the campus, said Officer David Hartman, a New Haven Police spokesman. \n \n \"All he really said was that his roommate was on his way to the university, to Yale University, to shoot people,\" he said. \n \n Police later received reports from witnesses who reported seeing someone with a gun, Hartman said. He said that there was nothing specific about the threat and that the call lasted just several seconds. \n \n There were no reports of shots fired or anyone injured. \n \n Police blocked off several streets near the Ivy League university, located in the heart of New Haven. Several local schools also were placed in lockdown. \n \n Yale advised students and staff to shelter in place. The school also issued an advisory asking people off campus to stay away from the area. \n \n The school is on November break, with undergraduate classes to resume Dec. 2. Many students and staff had left campus for the American holiday of Thanksgiving. \n \n Pedestrian traffic in the normally bustling area also was sparse, with cold and windy weather keeping many people inside. \n \n Police in tactical gear entered several buildings, and a helicopter hovered over the area. \n \n Yale has been the target of violence in the past. In May 2003, a bomb damaged an empty classroom and adjacent reading room at the law school. \n \n A Yale professor, David J. Gelernter, was seriously injured in 1993, when a mail bomb mailed by Theodore Kaczynski, the man known as the Unabomber, exploded in his campus office. \n \n Friday's search came about two weeks after a scare on another Connecticut campus. \n \n Central Connecticut State University was in lockdown for several hours Nov. 4 after reports by witnesses of a masked man carrying a gun or sword. \n \n Police arrested a student, David Kyem, who said he had been wearing a ninja-like Halloween costume and meant no harm. He faces charges including breach of peace. ||||| A day-long lockdown of the Yale University campus was lifted this evening after authorities determined that a call warning of a gunman intent on shooting people was likely a hoax. \n \n Yale's New Haven, Conn., campus was put on lockdown after an anonymous male called 911 this morning to say his roommate was on his way to the campus with the intention of shooting people, according to officials. \n \n New Haven Police Chief Dean Esserman said there was \"malicious intent\" behind the call. However, after a search of the campus did not reveal any threats, he said authorities are \"leaning toward this being a hoax.\" \n \n Esserman said once police identify the caller, that person \"will face every charge possibly imaginable.\" \n \n The anonymous call was placed from a phone booth and the university sent out an alert at 10:17 a.m. ET. \n \n At a news conference earlier today, New Haven Police Officer David Hartman said authorities interviewed several witnesses who said they saw someone with a \"long gun.\" \n \n After speaking with some of the witnesses, Hartman said, \"Some of those witnesses in all probability saw police officers with long guns instead of a suspect.\" \n \n Yale Police Chief Ronell Higgins said this incident showed that the school's emergency preparedness plan worked well. \n \n \"You have to exchange business cards with local law enforcement and schools before incidents like this one,\" he said. \"We are always in constant communication.\" \n \n An email was also sent by Yale's dean to notify parents of undergraduate students of the threat. \n \n The school is on its November break, meaning there are fewer people on campus than usual. \n \n An alert send by the university this morning instructed people to shelter in place. \n \n \"Confirmed report of person with a gun on/near Old Campus. SHELTER IN PLACE. This is NOT a test,\" the alert said. \n \n A search of the campus dorms was hampered because some students refused to open their doors to police, fearing that the person knocking was not really a police officer. \n \n The university has over 11,000 students.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nYale University has lifted its lockdown after police said an anonymous call about a gunman headed to campus was probably a hoax, reports the AP. \"New Haven is safe. The Yale campus is safe,\" said New Haven's police chief. \"Though it is starting to tilt in the direction of an innocent mistake, it started with a purposeful and malicious call.\" A New Haven police officer said earlier that the caller claimed \"that his roommate was on his way to the university, to Yale University, to shoot people.\" Several witnesses reported seeing someone with a \"long gun,\" but there were no reports of shots fired or injuries, ABC News reports. During the lockdown, police blocked off several streets near the school and advised students and faculty to either stay off campus, or stay where they were on campus.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\n\"Ms. Delgado was involved in the planning and the commission of the offense,\" Geron said. \"It was a murder for hire,\" he said. \n \n Hatcher was fatally shot in the parking garage of her upscale apartment building.

KMBC reports the Kearney Police Department fielded a tip from someone who saw a woman who looked like Tibbetts at a truck stop near I-35 and Missouri 92 Highway on July 26; that location is about 230 miles from where Tibbetts was last seen, reports ABC News. Kearney officers \"spoke with all possible witnesses, and reviewed all available video footage,\" per a statement. A rep for the department says if they had seen Tibbetts in the footage that would have been mentioned in the statement; it was not, indicating there is no footage that backs up the witness' claim. As for the claim, the rep added police only spoke with one person who reported seeing a Tibbetts lookalike at the truck stop. Des Moines station KCCI says a number of its viewers sent it screenshots of a Facebook post regarding the possible sighting, which noted Tibbetts \"might have been drugged, looked disoriented, and was with a truck driver.\" KCCI did not share that post. Tibbetts was last seen jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa, on July 18.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Since May 2009, the Rose family -- the home’s only owners -- had had the property on and off the market. \n \n The final sale price was for less than half of the $2.3 million that the Rose family initially had sought for the property in May 2009. It later was reduced to $1.8 million and then to $1.65 million before coming off the market in 2011 for some light rehab work. For a time, the property remained off the market but still informally listed. \n \n In August the Rose family relisted the property for $1.5 million and later cut its asking price to $1.375 million, $1.275 million and $1.25 million before finally going under contract in January. The four-bedroom main house was built in 1953 and designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe disciple A. James Speyer, while the pavilion was designed by David Haid and constructed about 20 years later to house an exotic car collection. \n \n In a classic scene late in the film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” the titular character’s best friend, Cameron Frye, sends a classic 1961 Ferrari crashing through the pavilion’s plate glass windows into the ravine. \n \n Features in the pavilion include a kitchen, a bath and room for four cars. The sellers recently renovated the pavilion’s windows and steel. \n \n The agent for the buyers, Mindy Shea of @properties, declined to comment on the purchase. \n \n News of the sale was first reported by Crain's Chicago Business. ||||| Five years after it first came on the market, the two-building modernist home in Highland Park that played a memorable role in “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” sold today. \n \n The final sale price was $1.06 million, said Craig Hogan, regional director at Coldwell Banker Previews, the luxury division of the real estate brokerage, which represented the house. That's less than half the $2.3 million that the sellers, the family of Francis and the late Ben Rose, originally listed it for in 2009. \n \n By the time of the sale, the asking price had been cut to $1.2 million. \n \n “Talk about a journey,” Mr. Hogan said. After the home first went on the market, it attracted worldwide media attention because of its movie role. In the 1986 John Hughes film, the smaller of the home's two black, glassy buildings is the garage where the father of Ferris' friend Cameron keeps a precious 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder convertible that the teenagers take out for a joyride.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAfter more than five years on and off the market, an Illinois home made famous in Ferris Bueller's Day Off has sold. The home, located in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, is the one where Bueller's best friend Cameron lives in the movie—and where he sends his dad's classic Ferrari through the plate glass windows of the home's auto pavilion and into a ravine after the characters' iconic joyride. The detached pavilion, too, was included in the $1.06 million sale, which went through Thursday, the Chicago Tribune reports. The Rose family, the only owners of the 5,300-square-foot midcentury modernistic home, initially listed the property in May 2009 for $2.3 million; the price was later reduced and reduced again before the home came off the market to get work done in 2011. It was re-listed in August for $1.5 million, followed by three more price reductions; it finally went under contract in January after the price was cut to $1.25 million. After it was re-listed, Coldwell Banker began emphasizing the property's \"architectural pedigree,\" Crain's Chicago Business notes; the steel and glass \"box\" was designed in 1953 by James Speyer. The buyers are an investment banker and a lawyer, both alums of Northwestern University.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Let's pray the message of God's love in Christ will conquer that of darkness and hate!\" \n \n Hmm. \n \n The apparent logic of the Swedish church Livets Ord, or \"Word of Life,\" is that by using a tactic that simulates the airstrikes that have traumatized a region, they will bring light and love and maybe convert some Muslims to Christianity. \n \n \"We start our project in a few weeks and hope to drop thousands of Bibles,\" the church's website says. The Bibles are \"pillbox\"-size and will supposedly be dropped from high altitude by a contractor hired by the church. \n \n Faced with scorn from the media, Christian Akerhielm, the church's missions director, has emphasized that the drone campaign adds to their good work in the region, which involves distributing aid at refugee camps. \n \n \"The project has been in the media portrayed as an ‘attack on IS’ or with the terror group as the main target.

The church plans to drop Arabic-language electronic Bibles, which will not need to be plugged in to work. The church's missions director says the plan \"is not connected to any military or aggressive action in any way,\" but has a lot in common with traditional smuggling of Bibles into places like the Soviet Union, the Washington Post reports. On its Facebook page, the church says the Bible drop is happening in parallel with the church's other work in the region, including providing medical care in refugee camps.

bso ), a large hiatal hernia, and cecal tubular adenoma removed endoscopically . \n thirty minutes after this colonoscopy, she was found to be hypotensive, with a systolic blood pressure of 71 over a diastolic pressure of 51, diaphoretic, pale, and nervous . \n she was admitted to the intensive care unit with a hemoglobin level of 8.4g / dl and a hematocrit of 25%, placed on norepinephrine to support her blood pressure, and transfused with packed red blood cells . \n the surgical service was asked to consult the following day, after she remained hypotensive, required multiple blood transfusions, and had a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan that showed massive hemoperitoneum ( figure 1 ) . at this time, she was taken for emergency laparotomy, during which she was found to have splenic rupture with avulsion of the splenic capsule and splenocolic ligaments . \n the spleen was a normal size, measuring 54 g with no pathology found on gross or microscopic examination . \n postoperatively, she did well and was transferred from the intensive care unit to a regular surgical floor on postoperative day 2 . \n a 60-year - old male presented to the emergency department 16 hours after a screening colonoscopy, during which he underwent sigmoid polypectomy of a 5-mm, tubular adenoma . upon presentation to the emergency department, he was complaining of 8 hours of worsening right lower quadrant ( rlq ) pain, nausea, and vomiting . \n his past medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and hyperlipidemia . on admission, \n computed tomography scan demonstrated a retrocecal appendix with a small appendicolith, wall thickening, and periappendiceal inflammation . \n the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for a grossly inflamed appendix with fecalith . \n colonoscopy is a fairly safe procedure, with bleeding and perforation reported as the most common complications . \n other, rare, complications include hepatic portal vein gas, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and diverticulitis, among others . \n the rare complications of colonoscopy we have reported, cases of splenic rupture and appendicitis, occur with infrequency . \n computed tomography can be useful when the diagnosis is not clear in a patient who has recently undergone a colonoscopy and presents with significant physical findings . \n not previously reported is one factor unique to our case of splenic rupture, entry into the ileum with ileal biopsy . \n this could theoretically contribute to increased torque of the scope at the splenic flexure secondary to the increased working distance of the scope . \n these rare complications that we have reported often present with nonspecific signs of abdominal pain, and clinicians must have a high index of suspicion and awareness of these entities to make their diagnosis .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nBackground : appendicitis and splenic rupture are 2 rare complications of colonoscopy reported in the literature . to our knowledge splenic rupture following colonoscopy has been reported 17 times in the english - language literature and is associated with excess traction on the splenocolic ligament . \n appendicitis after colonoscopy has been reported only 9 times and is usually associated with obstruction of the appendiceal lumen with fecal matter during colonoscopy . \n methods : we present the case reports of 2 patients : a 76-year - old woman who presented in consultation 24 hours after a routine colonoscopy with massive hemoperitoneum secondary to splenic rupture, seen on computed tomographic ( ct ) scan, who then underwent splenectomy ; the second, a 60-year - old male who presented to the emergency room 16 hours after colonoscopy with clinical and computed tomographic scan findings of acute appendicitis who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy . results : treatment of both patients resulted in resolution of their complications, splenic rupture and appendicitis . \n they both had an uneventful postoperative course and are doing well several months postoperatively . \n conclusions : we report 2 rare complications of colonoscopy, splenic rupture and appendicitis . in the setting of a recent colonoscopy and abdominal pain, a high index of suspicion is needed for their diagnosis .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nNBC Bay Area has learned that authorities investigating the deadly Camp Fire have tied its origin to the failure of a single steel hook that held up a high voltage line on a nearly 100-year-old high voltage transmission tower. Investigative reporter Jaxon Van Derbeken reports. (Published Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018) \n \n NBC Bay Area has learned that authorities investigating the deadly Camp Fire have tied its origin to the failure of a single steel hook that held up a high voltage line on a nearly 100-year-old PG&E transmission tower. \n \n The fire began at the base of a transposition tower, which serves to redistribute the electricity on the system to balance the load and assure safety. The tower has two arms holding out the “jumper,” a part of the line that’s being shifted to another point at the top of the tower. \n \n The arms each hold electrical insulators, which resemble a series of white discs. Authorities believe the fire started with the fracturing of a steel hook that holds up the insulators to the arms above. It is one of those hooks, sources with knowledge of the investigation say, that failed in high winds the morning of Nov. 8. \n \n “PG&E failed to maintain the tower, and they have an obligation to do that -- and it means they are liable for this disaster,’’ said attorney Dario de Ghetaldi, who is suing the utility over the fire. \n \n Cal Fire would not comment for this story, citing the ongoing investigation. PG&E would not address our information on the apparent cause, instead sending us a statement saying, “The cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation. We continue to focus on assessing infrastructure, safely restoring power where possible and helping our customers recover and rebuild.” \n \n But Frank Pitre, another attorney who has sued over both wildfires and the San Bruno gas explosion, worries the hook failure is just more evidence that PG&E is simply not able to deal with the risk posed by its system. \n \n “That’s a red flag,” he said, a warning that parts of the system could fail due to corrosion and fatigue from decades of service. \n \n “You have to a have a rigorous system of inspection, particularly when you have systems that are 50 years old or more. You can’t just visually inspect these things.’’ \n \n De Ghetaldi says PG&E should have done those detailed inspections after 2012, when five towers collapsed during a winter wind storm. “They should have taken a serious look at the entire circuit,” he said, “after those five towers collapsed in 2012, and it appears they didn’t do that. That’s a big problem for PG&E. And it’s a big problem for the people who were killed, who were made homeless, and who were harmed in many ways.” ||||| The Camp Fire has produced an online interactive evacuation map for citizens to view.

Specifically, a steel hook that held up a high voltage line on a Pacific Gas & Electric transmission tower, sources tell NBC Bay Area. There had already been much speculation that PG&E, the state's largest utility, is to blame for the wildfire that burned through more than 153,000 acres, destroying the entire town of Paradise and killing at least 85. One of the company's power lines was reportedly causing sparks just before the fire started Nov. 8, and multiple lawsuits have been filed against the utility by fire victims. Now, sources say, investigators have determined a hook on a nearly century-old PG&E transposition tower failed in high winds the morning the fire started—and it started at the base of that tower. Neither Cal Fire nor PG&E would comment on NBC's story, but an attorney representing fire victims alleges PG&E failed to properly maintain its equipment, and another attorney suggests the utility may have more problems in store if it can't keep its aging equipment safe. See the NBC report for more, including video showing wires dangling where the hook failed on the tower. (Was the president right about California wildfires?)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA pregnant Texas teenager is suing her parents to stop them from forcing her to abort her unborn child. \n \n Click2Houston reports a judge issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the abortion while the case is ongoing. \n \n The 16-year-old, who is identified only by the initials R.E.K. because she is a minor, claims in the lawsuit her parents are coercing her to abort her 9-week-old fetus through both verbal and physical threats and harassment. \n \n \"(The father) stated he was going to take her to have an abortion and that the decision was his, end of story,\" a copy of the lawsuit obtained by Click2Houston says. \n \n Click here to read the lawsuit. \n \n The lawsuit claims R.E.K.'s parents kept her home from school, took her phone and car and that she, the father of her child and the child's paternal grandmother have been harassed by her father.

Supporters included 31 House Democrats — but not Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who publicly backs the pipeline. Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash voted “present.” \n \n (Also on POLITICO: GOP rules change may hit Ryan) \n \n The Senate on Tuesday will take up identical Keystone legislation, which is being promoted heavily by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) in advance of her Dec. 6 runoff election. But under a deal with Republicans, the bill that clears the Senate would be the House version sponsored by her runoff opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). \n \n As of Friday afternoon, Keystone supporters could count on backing from 59 senators, including every Republican senator and 14 Democrats. The latest was Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), whom Landrieu listed as a supporter during a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon. \n \n The pro-Keystone side is still waiting for word on whether Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) or Angus King (I-Maine) will come down on their side. Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), an avowed “no” on the bill as recently as Thursday, is also facing pressure to switch sides. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Bennet brings Senate's pro-Keystone count to 59) \n \n One senator previously seen as on the fence, Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar, said Friday that she’s voting no. \n \n During a news conference in Myanmar earlier Friday, Obama scoffed at Keystone supporters’ arguments that the Alberta-to-Texas oil pipeline would be a major economic boon. \n \n “I have to constantly push back against the idea that Keystone is either a massive jobs bill for the U.S. or is somehow lowering gas prices,” Obama said during his joint appearance with dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi. \n \n The president also seemed to endorse the argument — pushed by Keystone opponents like billionaire Tom Steyer — that the oil moving through the pipeline would end up being exported abroad. “Understand what the project is, it will provide the ability for Canada to pump their oil and send it through their land down to the Gulf where it will be sold everywhere else,” he said. ||||| Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue. \n \n The new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website: \n \n We use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

In terms of getting the pipeline built, the vote doesn't mean much, observes the New York Times. But in terms of the Senate runoff in Louisiana, it looms large. The House measure approved today (as expected) was sponsored by Republican Bill Cassidy, who faces Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in that Dec. 6 runoff, reports the Washington Post. Both favor the pipeline and are trying to impress the voters back home. Landrieu's test comes Tuesday, when the Senate votes. If she can get 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, the measure goes straight to President Obama's desk. As of now, it's uncertain whether she'll succeed, and even if she does, President Obama seems all but certain to veto it, reports Politico. The Hill agrees, citing Obama's \"strong signals\" that he wants to wait for a federal review to be completed. It adds that a veto \"could deal a blow to Landrieu's chances in the runoff.\" For the record, the House vote was 252-161, with 31 Democrats joining Republicans. Every Republican voted in favor, except for libertarian-leaning Justin Amash of Michigan.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was practiced by such literary giants as Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy and Joseph Conrad. It fell out of favor in the last fifty years, but is now making a rebound thanks to the iPhone. \n \n Apple is showcasing two new e-reading apps under their new and notable category on the main App Store homepage. PigeonHole and Serial Reader both deliver classic novels into bite sized snippets that are easy to digest and appeals to readers who only have a few minutes to read each day. \n \n Not only are indie app developers getting involved in serializing classic novels, but major publishers such as Simon & Schuster are also getting involved. A few months ago they developed a new iPhone app called Crave, that lets you subscribe to your favorite author and receive bite sized updates of new novels every 24 hours. \n \n Crave makes reading e-books more enjoyable for people who are too busy to breeze through a full length novel. Since only bite sized chunks are delivered on a daily basis, it is a great way to kill some time when you are waiting for transit to arrive, on your break or have a few minutes to spare during the day. \n \n Not only does this app encourage women to read, but to also discover new authors. Every week a new author is added to the platform and this month there are e-books contributed by Colleen Hoover, Abbi Glines and K.A. Tucker. \n \n Rooster is a new company that launched last year and charges users a monthly subscription to access serialized content, instead of charging a fee for each title. The co-founder and editorial director Yael Goldstein Love spoke to Good e-Reader today about the appeal of serialized subscription reading. While much of the content is currently in the public domain or sourced from the company’s other site, Daily Lit, a different model is underway in which classics are paired with contemporary content. \n \n “We’ve been working directly with authors to try to create content that is specifically tailored for the Rooster experience.” \n \n The shorter length of Rooster content is perfect for smartphone reading during snippets of time, something that speaks to the company’s model. Rather than luring consumers with a model that affords them the ability to read mountains of content for one price, Rooster’s clientele is expected to read serialized and novella-length works for far less than the cost of a typical e-book subscription plan. \n \n I think serialized fiction is one of the those segments in publishing that is enjoying a resurgence, thanks to technology. Some companies are simply cutting up classic, royalty free novels into bite sized chunks, while others are taking modern novels, and just delivering a little bit at a time. I don’t think there is a definitive business model yet that will net someone a million dollars, but I like the fact more people are experimenting. \n \n ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: \n \n - Slash pages from every domain on the web: \n \n \n \n \n \n -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) \n \n \n \n -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain \n \n - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph ||||| Trying to knock some classic books off your bucket list?

But if you’re looking for a way to fit more reading into your day, it’s a pretty elegant solution. \n \n Users should know that the key word here is “classics” — you’re not going to find modern bestsellers. There’s a small selection now, but the app developer’s notes say the library is expanding daily. For those who are intimidated by thick, leather-bound tomes, Serial Reader is an good way to break it all down. \n \n Free, for iOS devices.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAs daunting as it may seem, you can read Crime and Punishment—20 minutes at a time. Serial Reader is a free iOS app that breaks down dozens of the classics into manageable chunks that are sent to your iPhone or iPad each day at a time you choose, Chris Taylor reports at Mashable. At that rate, the aforementioned Dostoyevsky tome will take you 79 days to read. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein comes in at 28 days. And you could finish The Star Lord by Boyd Ellanby in just 10. \"This just might be the reading mode of the future,\" Taylor writes. Good e-Reader points out that serialized fiction first became popular in the newspapers of Victorian England. And after decades on the decline, it \"is now making a rebound thanks to the iPhone.\" Even publisher Simon & Schuster is getting in on the action with an app called Crave, which charges a fee, as do apps Pigeonhole and Rooster. What makes Serial Reader different is that it's free, according to the Washington Post. \"Users should know that the key word here is 'classics,'\" Hayley Tsukayama writes. \"You’re not going to find modern bestsellers.\" And if you're the type of reader who likes to skip ahead, she notes, Serial Reader can be frustrating. However, it's an \"elegant solution\" to the problem of finding time to read. Taylor says he found the 20-minute reading time to be an overestimate—it took him, \"not a particularly fast reader,\" about 15 minutes to complete a day's reading. Also, he notes, you can download an entire text if you choose. (Not into reading? This app will give you the \"most intense game of solitaire\" you've ever played.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nROANOKE, Va - The flash flood warning for Lynchburg is now lasting until 2 a.m. Saturday. \n \n At 5:48 p.m., Lynchburg Emergency Management reported that water is holding within the shores of College Lake. \n \n While the situation continues to remain stable, emergency officials will monitor the dam through the overnight hours and draining will commence Saturday morning. \n \n As a result, the National Weather Services has extended the flash flood warning as a precaution. \n \n Flash Flood Warning continues for Lynchburg VA until 2:00 AM EDT pic.twitter.com/ECfSUoI8Vt — NWS Blacksburg (@NWSBlacksburg) August 3, 2018 \n \n A flash flood warning now remains in effect until 6 p.m. for the city of Lynchburg. \n \n CLICK HERE for a list of current road closures. \n \n The potential for more heavy rain continues into the morning.

They warned, however, that the potential remains for more heavy rains that could result in more flooding. \n \n Should the dam completely fail, enough water levels in the affected part of the city could rise to 17 feet in just 7 minutes, said local media, citing emergency officials. \n \n Earlier in the day, up to a foot and a half of water was seen flowing across Lakeside Drive and into Blackwater Creek after spilling out of the dam, NWS Blacksburg said. \n \n The dam was above capacity after storms dropped more than 6 inches of rain in just 24 hours upstream from College Lake, weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman said. \n \n Lynchburg has seen an exceptional amount of rain so far in 2018. More than 12 inches of rain have fallen on the city since June 1st, bringing the annual year-to-date total to more than 37 inches. That's more than a foot above the average for this time of the year, making this the third wettest year-to-date at Lynchburg Regional Airport since 1945. \n \n And it's not over. \n \n \"Unfortunately, one final round of rain, potentially locally heavy, is expected in the Piedmont area of Virginia Friday before drier weather moves in for the weekend,\" Erdman said. \n \n College Lake Dam was built in the 1930s and is listed among \"high hazard dams\" in need of repair in Virginia. \n \n In Campbell County, about 13 inches of water was spilling over the Timberlake Dam spillway and a motorist had to be rescued from a vehicle trapped in high water.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nSome 124 homes in Lynchburg, Va., are under evacuation orders with intense flooding in the region. The College Lake Dam, whose complete failure could put the downstream city of 80,000 under 17 feet of water in seven minutes, exceeded its capacity Thursday after four to six inches of rain fell, per WSLS and the BBC. The News & Advance reports 12 to 18 inches of water were flowing out of the dam, over a road, and into a creek after three inches of rain fell in a single hour. The dam \"is being closely monitored … for any signs of structural failure\" as another inch or so of rain is expected Friday near Lynchburg, 50 miles east of Roanoke, according to the National Weather Service. \"This remains a dangerous situation.\" Footage shows only roofs of cars visible on flooded roads. Those whose homes are considered at risk due to flooding have been moved to temporary shelters, per the News & Advance, which notes some 5,200 residents of Lynchburg and Timberlake were without power Friday morning. A flash flood watch remains in effect for much of central and western Virginia, while central Lynchburg is under a flash flood warning. Per Weather.com, the city is battling its third wettest year since 1945 in which more than 12 inches of rain have fallen since June 1. That brings its annual year-to-date total to more than 37 inches, or more than a foot above last year's total as of this date.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDow Jones is reporting that Apple will unveil its 2017 iPhone lineup at a special event scheduled for Tuesday, September 12. While Apple has yet to issue official invites for the event, the September 12th date does align with previous rumors that recently emerged over the past few days. Assuming that the September 12 date is in fact accurate, Apple in just about two weeks will introduce a brand new iPhone 7s and an iPhone 7s Plus. Of course, it goes without saying that the main attraction at Apple’s upcoming event will be the highly anticipated iPhone 8, a device which may very well usher in the largest iPhone refresh Apple has ever seen. \n \n At this point, it’s no secret what the iPhone 8 will bring to the table. According to a number of credible sources, the iPhone 8 will feature a edgeless OLED display and will incorporate advanced facial recognition technology. What’s interesting, though, is that the inclusion of facial recognition technology might see Apple remove Touch ID altogether. From what we can gather so far, Apple initially wanted to embed the Touch ID sensor underneath the OLED display itself, only to abandon this approach after encountering a yield issues during initial production runs. \n \n As for other iPhone 8 features we can expect to see, Apple’s next-gen device will likely incorporate a new wireless charging feature. Though Android smartphones have had wireless charging for quite some time, it’s nice to see Apple finally deciding to join the party. On a related note, a recent iPhone 8 rumor claims that wireless charging on Apple’s next-gen device will not be up to par with what some Android smartphone owners already enjoy. As we covered earlier, rumor has it that the iPhone 8 — along with Apple’s iPhone 7s lineup — will only support Qi’s slower wireless charging standard. \n \n As for some other iPhone 8 tidbits worth mentioning, it’s believed that the entry-level iPhone 8 will sport 64GB of storage, with more premium models offering users 256GB and 512GB of storage. Price wise, The New York Times recently published a report indicating that the entry-level iPhone 8 will start at $999, easily making it the most expensive iPhone model ever released. \n \n Lastly, we’ve also seen rumors claiming that pre-orders for the iPhone 8 will open up on Friday, September 15 ahead of a worldwide launch on Friday, September 22, two dates which fit in nicely with the aforementioned September 12th unveiling. \n \n New iPhones aside, Apple on September 12 will also unveil a revamped version of the Apple Watch along with a brand new 4K capable Apple TV. \n \n Update: The Wall Street Journal also has a report corroborating the September 12th date, adding that the event will be held in the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater located at the company’s new spaceship campus. \n \n Developing… ||||| Apple Inc. has scheduled a product-announcement event on Sept. 12, according to people briefed on its plans, reinforcing expectations that the technology giant will release new iPhones and a smartwatch well ahead of the holiday shopping season. \n \n The company is expected to unveil three iPhones, according to other people familiar with its plans. Those include a showcase iPhone to mark the product’s 10th anniversary that is larger and pricier and features an edge-to-edge display and facial-recognition technology, as well as updates...\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThose waiting to upgrade their iPhones can expect to see the new options on Sept. 12. The Wall Street Journal reports that as the date for the next Apple product unveiling. Assuming that's the case—last-minute production glitches could throw off the schedule—customers should be able to order about 10 days afterward. Apple is expected to offer updated versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but most eyes will be on the new iPhone 8, rumored to be an ambitious upgrade to mark the phone's 10th anniversary. \"At this point, it's no secret what the iPhone 8 will bring to the table,\" notes a post at BGR, ticking off features such as an OLED display, advanced facial recognition, and wireless charging. In addition to the phones, Apple also is expected to unveil an upgraded Apple Watch and Apple TV. (Expect to pony up for the iPhone 8—it's expected to be the most expensive iPhone yet, with some reports suggesting a price of up to $1,400.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAs we now move into the official Political Aftermath period of the Boston bombing -- the period that will determine the long-term legislative fallout of the atrocity -- the dynamics of privilege will undoubtedly influence the nation's collective reaction to the attacks. That's because privilege tends to determine: 1) which groups are -- and are not -- collectively denigrated or targeted for the unlawful actions of individuals; and 2) how big and politically game-changing the overall reaction ends up being. \n \n This has been most obvious in the context of recent mass shootings. In those awful episodes, a religious or ethnic minority group lacking such privilege would likely be collectively slandered and/or targeted with surveillance or profiling (or worse) if some of its individuals comprised most of the mass shooters. However, white male privilege means white men are not collectively denigrated/targeted for those shootings -- even though most come at the hands of white dudes. \n \n Likewise, in the context of terrorist attacks, such privilege means white non-Islamic terrorists are typically portrayed not as representative of whole groups or ideologies, but as \"lone wolf\" threats to be dealt with as isolated law enforcement matters. Meanwhile, non-white or developing-world terrorism suspects are often reflexively portrayed as representative of larger conspiracies, ideologies and religions that must be dealt with as systemic threats -- the kind potentially requiring everything from law enforcement action to military operations to civil liberties legislation to foreign policy shifts. \n \n \"White privilege is knowing that even if the bomber turns out to be white, no one will call for your group to be profiled as terrorists as a result, subjected to special screening or threatened with deportation,\" writes author Tim Wise. \"White privilege is knowing that if this bomber turns out to be white, the United States government will not bomb whatever corn field or mountain town or stale suburb from which said bomber came, just to ensure that others like him or her donâ€™t get any ideas. And if he turns out to be a member of the Irish Republican Army we wonâ€™t bomb Dublin. And if heâ€™s an Italian-American Catholic we wonâ€™t bomb the Vatican.\" \n \n Because of these undeniable and pervasive double standards, the specific identity of the Boston Marathon bomber (or bombers) is not some minor detail -- it will almost certainly dictate what kind of governmental, political and societal response we see in the coming weeks. That means regardless of your particular party affiliation, if you care about everything from stopping war to reducing the defense budget to protecting civil liberties to passing immigration reform, you should hope the bomber was a white domestic terrorist. Why? Because only in that case will privilege work to prevent the Boston attack from potentially undermining progress on those other issues. ||||| Interesting enough. But Sears also included a long exegesis of what it meant that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had the name of the bloody 15th century central Asian-Muslim warlord Tamerlane, which he said was akin \"to naming an American child 'Stalin-Mao-Hitler.\" Which seemed to indicate he considered the Tsarnaevs more Asian, or maybe \"Cock-Asian,\" than good old-fashioned American white. \n \n We still know comparatively little about the Tsarnaev brothers, but they seem to have more in common with other American mass murderers than with al-Qaida terrorists of any race and ethnicity. No less an expert than former CIA Deputy Director Philip Mudd said on Fox News Sunday that they have more in common with the Columbine killers than with hardened al-Qaida terrorists. Likewise, Columbine expert Dave Cullen compares the “dyad” of apparent mastermind Tamerlan and follower-younger brother Dzhokhar to the Columbine pair of disturbed plot architect Eric Harris and follower Dylan Klebold.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nConservatives jumped all over a Salon columnist who wrote a piece last week headlined, \"Let's Hope the Boston Marathon Bomber Is a White American\"—and when the suspects were revealed, conservatives gloated that they were not, in fact, white Americans. But the Tsarnaev brothers \"are quite literally Caucasian, as in from the Caucuses,\" writes Joan Walsh on Salon. Plus, the US Census Bureau considers Americans of Chechen or Russian descent to be white, and one of the brothers was a naturalized American citizen. So why don't right-wingers consider them to be white? Walsh considers a few possibilities: America has a history of \"sorting white from non-white.\" Many European immigrants \"became\" white as time went on, society became more accepting, and decidedly \"non-white\" people started arriving. \"Embracing racism and xenophobia, sadly, could be a shortcut to white status for previously non-white European immigrants.\" Of course, it could boil down to the simple fact that the Tsarnaevs are Muslim, immigrants, or simply that \"they’re 'bad,' and whiteness must be surrendered when white people are bad,\" Walsh writes. But, Walsh points out, the brothers actually have more in common with other mass murderers than they do with al-Qaeda terrorists. By insisting they're not white, conservatives are simply proving the original Salon columnist's point: White American murderers basically escape scapegoating and racial profiling, but with the Tsarnaevs being viewed as non-white, you can expect \"a destructive new wave of ... anti-Muslim agitation [and] generalized xenophobia.\" Click for Walsh's full column.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\n﻿﻿﻿﻿Researchers in Aalto University have developed a new concept for computing, using water droplets as bits of digital information. This was enabled by the discovery that upon collision with each other on a highly water-repellent surface, two water droplets rebound like billiard balls. \n \n In the work, published in the journal Advanced Materials, the researchers experimentally determined the conditions for rebounding of water droplets moving on superhydrophobic surfaces. In the study, a copper surface coated with silver and chemically modified with a fluorinated compound was used. This method enables the surface to be so water-repellent that water droplets roll off when the surface is tilted slightly. Superhydrophobic tracks, developed during a previous study, were employed for guiding droplets along designed paths. \n \n Using the tracks, the researchers demonstrated that water droplets could be turned into technology, \"superhydrophobic droplet logic.\" For example, a memory device was built where water droplets act as bits of digital information. Furthermore, devices for elementary Boolean logic operations were demonstrated. These simple devices are building blocks for computing. \n \n Video: http://youtu.be/GTnVwyWaVQw (Superhydrophobic droplet logic: flip-flop memory) \n \n Furthermore, when the water droplets are loaded with reactive chemical cargo, the onset of a chemical reaction could be controlled by droplet collisions. Combination of the collision-controlled chemical reactions with droplet logic operations potentially enables programmable chemical reactions where single droplets serve simultaneously as miniature reactors and bits for computing. \n \n Video: http://youtu.be/ygMdQ9NUbok (Chemical reaction controlled by droplet collisions) \n \n \"It is fascinating to observe a new physical phenomenon for such everyday objects -- water droplets,\" says Robin Ras, an Academy Research Fellow in the Molecular Materials research group. \n \n \"I was surprised that such rebounding collisions between two droplets were never reported before, as it indeed is an easily accessible phenomenon: I conducted some of the early experiments on water-repellent plant leaves from my mother's garden,\" explains a member of the research group, Henrikki Mertaniemi, who discovered the rebounding droplet collisions two years ago during a summer student project in the research group of Ras and Academy Professor Olli Ikkala. \n \n The researchers foresee that the present results enable technology based on superhydrophobic droplet logic. Possible applications include autonomous simple logic devices not requiring electricity, and programmable biochemical analysis devices. \n \n Other related videos are available on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLstvxmQiQw29IYEmSVYPdRvG2efzR-jku ||||| Researchers at Aalto University have devised a way to convert tiny drops of water into encoded digital information, building a simple computer out of just water droplets and a water-repellant surface. A new study in the journal Advanced Materials demonstrates that, using a hydrophobic surface that causes water to bead up and roll off, researchers can follow the trails of individual water droplets along paths in the surface. That predictability allowed researchers to build simple computers like a memory device that tracks the droplets and encodes them as bits of information, with drops on one track representing ones and drops on the other representing zeroes. They even demonstrated machines that can use the technology to complete basic Boolean operations. \n \n The new technology is known as “superhydrophobic droplet logic,” (which means that Beck will have to think of a new name for his next album) and it doesn’t stop at just encoding information. By creating water droplets that carry chemical cargos and controlling where they went, the research team could even program chemical reactions. \n \n The research released today is just a proof of concept for now, and it will be years before the technique sees any practical applications — if it ever does. It’s an interesting and heretofore unheard of concept, though, and one that if developed further could lead to simple logic devices that can run without any electrical power. The programmable chemical reactions hold even more promise, with the potential to see use in simple chemical analysis systems that could sniff out pollution or diagnose disease. For right now, you can take a look at the video below to see the new technique in action. \n \n (via ScienceDaily, image courtesy of Aalto University) \n \n Relevant to your interests\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nCould the future of computers be water? Researchers in Finland may have laid the groundwork by converting water droplets into digital data. The concept came out of a discovery that water droplets on a water-repellent surface ricochet off each other like billiard balls, reports Science Daily. Scientists added tracks and were able to predict the paths of the droplets, and from this they were able to create Boolean logic operations, the foundation of computing. In an experiment, the scientists used a silver-coated copper surface to build a memory device in which water droplets acted as the bits of information. The technology has been named superhydrophobic droplet logic. Geekosystem's take: \"The research released today is just a proof of concept for now, and it will be years before the technique sees any practical applications—if it ever does. It’s an interesting and heretofore unheard of concept, though, and one that if developed further could lead to simple logic devices that can run without any electrical power.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

The asteroid is going 29,000 miles per hour, according to astronomers at the University of Arizona. \n \n It is the first time since 1976 that an asteroid ... ||||| Scientists at NASA's Near-Earth Object Programme, which tracks asteroids and comets, ruled out any chance of impact. They are using the close encounter to learn more about the space rock known as 2005 YU55. \n \n The last time a cosmic interloper this size came this close to Earth was in 1976 and it will not happen again until 2028. \n \n Since late last week, antennas at the space agency's Deep Space Network in California have been monitoring the quarter-mile-wide asteroid as it approaches from the direction of the sun. \n \n The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico planned a viewing Tuesday when the asteroid is set to make its closest pass at a distance of 202,000 miles at 11.28pm GMT. \n \n Since its discovery six years ago by a University of Arizona astronomer, scientists have learned a great deal about 2005 YU55. Its surface is coal black, and it spins slowly through space. \n \n Amateur skygazers who want a glimpse need two things: a good sky chart and a 6-inch telescope or larger since the asteroid is too faint to detect with the naked eye. Even with a telescope, sighting is not guaranteed. The glare from the moon may make the asteroid difficult to spot.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAt 6:28pm Eastern time tonight, an aircraft carrier-sized asteroid will swing by Earth at a distance of 201,000 miles, which is within the moon’s orbit. That’s the closest an asteroid has come to the planet since 1976, but don’t worry: NASA has determined the space rock poses no threat, the Wall Street Journal reports. You won’t be able to view it with the naked eye, but if you have a good sky chart and a 6-inch or larger telescope, you may have a shot, the Telegraph adds. The 1,300-foot-wide 2005 YU55 is traveling at 29,000 miles per hour. Researchers have been monitoring it, and will learn more about it through radar images. Asteroids are among the solar system’s oldest objects, and astronomers hope to glean clues about the origins of life on our planet. “This is an extraordinary opportunity to look at an extremely important type of asteroid,” says one NASA scientist. “A small army of astronomers are pretty excited about it.” Click for more on the asteroid.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\na 75-year -

power magnification . \n serum chemical analysis showed a urea level of 26 mg / dl, a creatinine level of 1.5 mg / dl, and a c - reactive protein ( crp ) level of 0.99 mg / dl . \n after analgesic injection, her pain subsided . with a presumptive diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, \n the following day, the patient was admitted to the gastrointestinal department with persistent right abdominal pain . \n an abdominal computed tomographic ( ct ) scan was performed, which showed a dilated urinary bladder, hydronephroureterosis, and perinephric fluid collection . \n the patient was referred to our urologists, who recommended insertion of an indwelling foley catheter . \n because there was no delayed phase on ct, we performed a non - enhanced ct scan immediately . \n it showed extravasation of radiocontrast from the right upper ureter at the l3 to 4 transverse process level and improved hydronephroureterosis ( fig . \n after 7 days, antegrade pyelography ( agp ) performed through the nephrostomy catheter showed no extravasation of radiocontrast from the ureter ( fig . \n a double - j catheter ( 6 f, 24 cm ) was placed in the right ureter . \n after 2 weeks, the double - j catheter was removed and we subsequently performed a video - urodynamic study . \n in other words, the patient showed detrusor underactivity and no vesicoureteric reflux ( vur ) . \n it showed resorption of urinoma in the right peri - renal space and there was neither malignancy nor obstructing lesions . \n ureteric rupture is rare and can be traumatic or, less commonly, nontraumatic in nature . \n the most common cause of traumatic ureteric rupture is iatrogenic trauma, followed by penetrating trauma, and occasionally, blunt abdominal trauma . \n nontraumatic ureteric rupture includes transmitted back pressure from a downstream obstruction caused by ureteric stones, surgical ligature, or an abdominal or pelvic mass . \n the most common symptoms are sudden, severe, persistent lower abdominal pain with severe peritoneal irritation . \n another report described massive urinary leakage into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in abdominal compartment syndrome, respiratory distress, and anuria . \n ct scanning is considered the optimal evaluation for diagnosing ureteric rupture, because of the expected poor resolution of intravenous urography in an unprepared patient . \n also, one can obtain more accurate information about the location and the size of the urinoma on a ct scan, and the progression of its characteristics can be readily assessed . in this case, we diagnosed ureteric rupture easily by use of a ct scan . in delayed - phase images, \n many authors have resorted to open surgery earlier for complete management of spontaneous rupture and urinoma . \n the incidence of late complications, such as ureteric stricture, ureteropelvic stenosis, or peri - ureteric fibrosis remains unknown . \n believe that in urinary extravasation, treatment should be supportive initially ( i.e., careful observation and analgesics ) . persistent obstruction and severe pain, infection, and failing renal function \n although nontraumatic perforation of the ureter is relatively benign, it may predispose the patient to perinephric abscess . \n reported successful treatment of ureteric rupture by the insertion of a double - j ureteric stent under fluoroscopy . \n they achieved unobstructed urinary outflow, healing of the perforation, and stabilization and gradual absorption of the urinoma . in the modern era, \n open surgical intervention is rarely indicated, because minimally invasive techniques such as percutaneous drainage can be used to manage complications . in our case \n, there was no evidence of factors that cause ureteric rupture other than urinary retention . \n urinary retention may inhibit urinary flow to the bladder and result in high intraureteric pressure . \n as intraureteric pressure rises, the ureteric wall fails to withstand the pressure and becomes ruptured . \n urologists should be aware of the possibility of ureteric rupture in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen, particularly in patients with urinary retention . \n management of these patients should include minimally invasive techniques accompanied by active management of urinary retention .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPerforation of the ureter is a rare condition that causes a series of problems including retroperitoneal urinoma, urosepsis, abscess formation, infection, and subsequent renal impairment . \n there are causative factors that induce ureteric rupture, including malignancy, urinary calculi, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, recent iatrogenic manipulation, external trauma, degenerative kidney conditions, urography with external compression, and spontaneous causes . \n we report a rare case of ureteric rupture caused by urinary retention . \n the patient was treated with temporary percutaneous drainage and antibiotics . \n the present case illustrates that urinary retention can induce not only bladder rupture, but also ureteric rupture . \n it is thus of paramount importance to effectively manage patients with voiding problems .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nthe pore and cnbd sequences of the plant cyclic nucleotide - gated channels differ from the pore and cnbds in other plant ion channel families . \n phylogenies based on alignments of the pore, cnbd, or full - length cngc sequences are similar, showing that the evolution of these functional domains preceded the expansion of plant cngc genes that occurred after the split between green algae and higher plants, and that the split between dicots and monocots occurred after the advent of the higher plant cngcs . \n an alignment of just this motif region from the cngcs produces a cladogram that is almost identical to published phylogenies of the full - length sequences . \n this motif may therefore be used to refine tentative annotations and to find novel cngcs in newly sequenced plant genomes . whether this motif represents differences in the function or regulation of plant cngcs has yet to be evaluated . \n the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nLigand - gated cation channels are a frequent component of signaling cascades in eukaryotes . \n eukaryotes contain numerous diverse gene families encoding ion channels, some of which are shared and some of which are unique to particular kingdoms . among the many different types are cyclic nucleotide - gated channels ( cngcs ) . \n cngcs are cation channels with varying degrees of ion conduction selectivity . \n they are implicated in numerous signaling pathways and permit diffusion of divalent and monovalent cations, including ca2 + and k+ . \n cngcs are present in both plant and animal cells, typically in the plasma membrane ; recent studies have also documented their presence in prokaryotes . \n all eukaryote cngc polypeptides have a cyclic nucleotide - binding domain and a calmodulin binding domain as well as a six transmembrane / one pore tertiary structure . \n this review summarizes existing knowledge about the functional domains present in these cation - conducting channels, and considers the evidence indicating that plant and animal cngcs evolved separately . \n additionally, an amino acid motif that is only found in the phosphate binding cassette and hinge regions of plant cngcs, and is present in all experimentally confirmed cngcs but no other channels was identified . \n this cngc - specific amino acid motif provides an additional diagnostic tool to identify plant cngcs, and can increase confidence in the annotation of open reading frames in newly sequenced genomes as putative cngcs . \n conversely, the absence of the motif in some plant sequences currently identified as probable cngcs may suggest that they are misannotated or protein fragments .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe sacrifice of a Chinese television presenter, who died of cancer after refusing chemotherapy treatment while pregnant to stop her unborn child being harmed – has touched the hearts of thousands of people on the mainland. \n \n Qiu Yuanyuan, 26, from Zhengzhou, in the central province of Henan, died on Wednesday – exactly 100 days after giving birth to her son, Niannian. \n \n After getting married, becoming a mother was her biggest wish \n \n Qiu Yuanyuan’s husband, Zhang Qixuan \n \n The story of her selfless act has been one of the hottest topics on China’s microblogging site Weibo since yesterday, and reached more than 10 million views by this morning. \n \n Thousands of Weibo users, moved by her great courage and love for her baby son, posted comments commemorating Qiu and wishing her son a long and healthy life on Qui’s Weibo page. \n \n “After getting married, becoming a mother was her biggest wish,” Qiu’s husband, Zhang Qixuan, told the Zhengzhou Evening News. \n \n “She chose to save our child; she understood that not everything in life can be perfect. And she said she had never regretted her decision.” \n \n She chose to save our child; she understood that not everything in life can be perfect. And she said she had never regretted her decision \n \n Qiu Yuanyuan’s husband, Zhang Qixuan \n \n Qiu, who had hosted of a chess games show on Zhengzhou Television Station, learned she was pregnant in March. \n \n However, her happiness was cut short after the results of a physical examination revealed that Qiu was suffering from a late-stage malignant tumour, the newspaper reported. \n \n In order to prevent the baby being harmed by her chemotherapy, Qiu agreed to halt her treatment, which allowed the cancer to spread. \n \n When Qiu’s condition deteriorated in September, she was admitted to hospital where her son, Niannian – then only seven months old – was delivered by Caesarean section. The boy weighed a little more than 1.5kg at the time of the birth, the report said. \n \n Qiu then underwent an operation for the removal of the malignant tumour, but it came too late to save her. \n \n Despite undergoing more than 20 days of chemotherapy, her doctors said the chances of her being cured were very low. They advised Qiu to halt her remaining therapy and return home to her baby son. \n \n She died at her home on Wednesday evening, after her family held a feast to celebrate the baby’s 100th day since his birth – a traditional custom widely practiced by Chinese families. \n \n The report said Qiu’s husband, who worked as a journalist at the same TV station as Qiu, was way from home when she died, and was unable to be with her at the time. \n \n “Yuanyuan has passed away; the only thing I can do now is to take care our child and her family,” her husband was quoted as saying. \n \n “I hope everyone can silently bless her and our child, and smile at life – just as Yuanyuan did.” ||||| The fate of a Chinese television presenter who died of cancer after refusing chemotherapy to save her unborn son sparked intense online debate Friday. \n \n Qiu Yuanyuan died on Wednesday aged 26, 100 days after giving birth to her child -- a special occasion in Chinese culture. \n \n More than 10 million netizens viewed her story on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Friday, but many of those commenting questioned why she had sacrificed her life. \n \n \"I don't think it's good to give up on living, even if the mother's love is great,\" posted one netizen. \n \n \"It's not a beautiful thing if a child is born with no care and love from its natural mother.\" \n \n Qiu, from the central province of Henan, was told she was pregnant in March, the website of the People's Daily newspaper said. \n \n View gallery Family members and friends mourn during the funeral ceremony of Qiu Yuanyuan, a Chinese television p … \n \n But her \"hope turned to despair\" soon after when she was diagnosed with a late-stage cancer of the womb, it went on. \n \n Qiu decided to halt her treatment to prevent her baby being harmed, and the cancer soon spread. \n \n As her condition worsened, she was admitted to hospital in September when she gave birth to the boy, named Niannian. \n \n She eventually died as the family were celebrating his 100th day. \n \n \"Leaving a little life alone in the world, such a heartless mother,\" another netizen said. \n \n Others, however, were more sympathetic to her plight. \n \n \"Even chemotherapy cannot cure cancer, can it? So she chose this way, wise and helpless,\" said one poster. \n \n Another added: \"Mother's love is so great.\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAn up-and-coming TV host in Zhengzhou, China, always gave as much time as she could to her job, often working 14-hour days without complaint, a co-worker says. But when Qiu Yuanyuan became pregnant in March, her focus switched over to her unborn child—so much so that when she found out she had late-stage womb cancer in July, she opted not to go forward with chemo to protect her baby, Shanghaiist reports. In September she gave birth to 3.3-pound Niannian two months early via C-section, after which doctors tried to remove her tumor and begin chemo, but it was too late: Qiu died this month at home on Niannian's 100th day, a traditional Chinese celebration, the South China Morning Post reports. Qiu's choice has launched a back-and-forth online, with some lauding the young mother for a courageous, selfless act, and others insisting she should've tried harder to stay alive. One commenter in an online forum writes, \"She's a goddess and great mother. R.I.P.,\" as per Shanghaiist, while AFP mentions a Sina Weibo lament that states, \"It's not a beautiful thing if a child is born with no care and love from its natural mother\"; another commenter piles on: \"Leaving a little life alone in the world, such a heartless mother.\" Qiu's husband, a reporter at the same station as his wife, tells the Zhengzhou Evening News that her \"biggest wish\" had been to be a mom. \"She chose to save our child; she understood that not everything in life can be perfect,\" he says, per the Morning Post. \"And she said she had never regretted her decision.\" (A Colorado woman's family says her decision to have a C-section was the ultimate motherly sacrifice.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Some of their stars have dimmed, but Washington’s still shines brightly. He hasn’t had a film open to less than $20 million since 2007’s “The Great Debaters.” He’ll be back on screens at the end of the year in “Fences,” an adaptation of August Wilson’s play, that he directs and stars in alongside Viola Davis. It is expected to be an Oscar contender. \n \n “The Magnificent Seven” easily snagged the crown from “Sully,” the retelling of the “Miracle on the Hudson” landing that topped the box office for two weeks. The drama slid to third place with $13.8 million, bringing its stateside total to a healthy $92.4 million. \n \n “Storks,” an animated comedy from Warner Bros., came in second with $21.8 million. It’s a disappointing result given that the picture had been tracking to open to $30 million or higher. The film centers on a group of storks who have transitioned from baby delivering to hauling packed for an e-commerce behemoth. Andy Samberg, Kelsey Grammer, Jennifer Aniston, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jordan Peele are among the recognizable voices providing some of the film’s aural texture. The film cost $70 million to produce and is part of Warner Bros. effort to reinvigorate its animation division after the studio scored a hit with 2014’s “The Lego Movie.” It had more or less abandoned the genre to the likes of Disney and DreamWorks Animation, before undergoing a course correction. \n \n “The Magnificent Seven’s” success is welcome news for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was body checked this summer after “Ben-Hur,” its $100 million-plus Biblical epic, collapsed at the box office, resulting in at least $70 million in losses for the studio and its production co-financiers. Earlier this month, MGM reduced its annual profit projections by roughly $50 million because of “Ben-Hur’s” failure. \n \n But “The Magnificent Seven” counts as a win for the company. It also proves the viability of remaking older films, provided their is some novel spin to provide. In this case, Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, were able to stage balletic shootouts that rivaled those in John Sturges’ original 1960 film. They also played up the diversity of their cast, rounding out the cast of mercenaries with South Korean actor Byung-hun Lee, Mexican actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and Native American actor Martin Sensmeier. That multi-cultural aspect seemed to resonate in a post-#OscarsSoWhite era. Sony Pictures distributed “The Magnificent Seven” and teamed with MGM, LStar Capital, and Village Roadshow to finance the $90 million production. \n \n “Bridget Jones’s Baby” took fourth place with $4.5 million, pushing the romantic comedy’s domestic total to a lackluster $16.5 million after two weeks of release. “Blair Witch” rounded out the top five, earning just under $4 million and bringing its total to roughly $16 million. \n \n In limited release, “The Dressmaker,” an Australian comedy with Kate Winslet, opened to $180,522 in 38 locations. Broad Green is distributing the film on behalf of Amazon Studios. Disney’s “Queen of Katwe,” an inspirational drama about a chess prodigy from Uganda, debuted in 55 theaters to $305,000. It will expand next weekend to roughly 1,500 locations.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAntoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven remake rode the star power of Denzel Washington to an estimated $35 million debut, topping North American ticket sales over the weekend. It's another win for Washington: Reuters notes that the A-lister hasn't had a movie open to less than $20 million since The Great Debaters in 2007. Sony Pictures' estimate Sunday for The Magnificent Seven had the film far ahead of the week's other new release, Warner Bros.' Storks. The animated movie, starring Andy Samberg as a baby-delivering stork, opened with $21.8 million, reports the AP. A remake of John Sturges' 1960 film, which itself was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven slots in as one of the biggest openings for a Western ever. The genre-blending Cowboys & Aliens holds the Western record with a $36.4 million debut in 2011. In third place was Clint Eastwood's Sully, which took in $13.8 million in its third weekend.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nLONDON (AP) — Britain's Mail on Sunday says it has uncovered a major royal security breach by using an inexpensive app to track Prince William's air rescue ambulance while it is in the air. \n \n The paper said the 2.99 pound ($4.65) app allowed it to keep close track of William as he flew in his capacity as a private pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance in eastern England. \n \n It published photos claiming to show William's helicopter landing and of the prince himself. \n \n The paper said Sunday that William's helicopter flies at low altitude at a relatively slow speed. \n \n William's press office refused to comment on the report. The prince returned to work several weeks ago after paternity leave. ||||| A publicly available app which tracks air travel allows users to follow Prince William as he takes to the skies as an air ambulance pilot, it was claimed last night. \n \n There were warnings that ‘flightradar24’ app, which costs just £2.99 to download, could present a major security risk by providing precise details of his location. \n \n Reporters from the Mail On Sunday used the mobile phone software to see how the Prince could be tracked earlier this week and published photographs of him at work to show how the data had revealed where he had been. Military planes are concealed from the app’s users, but the same protection is not thought to be used for the air emergency services. \n \n The reporters said they received alerts every time his East Anglian Air Ambulance took off on a 999 call and landed. \n \n Dai Davies, the former head of the Met’s Royalty Protection Squad, told the newspaper: “This would give me cause for concern and solutions need to be found by those in charge of the Prince’s security. You always have to be aware of the advance of technology – which this illustrates – and the ability of these terrorist groups to think outside the box. You always, always have to be one step ahead.” \n \n Buckingham Palace and the Metropolitan police, which is responsible for royal protection, has not responded to the claims, nor have the app’s manufacturers. The Bond Aviation Group, which operates the East Anglian Air Ambulances, said it could not comment on security arrangements.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nNo sooner has Prince William begun a new job than cheap technology is out to ruin it for him: British tabloid journalists say they were able to track the man who's second in line to the throne as he made flights in his air ambulance using an app that goes for $3.99, reports the Independent citing the report in the Mail on Sunday. Reporters downloaded the flight-tracking Flightradar24 app—which blocks military flights, though not private air ambulance flights, from users—and say they received alerts every time William took to the skies over eastern England, raising what officials are calling a serious security risk. Says a former head of the Royalty Protection Squad: \"You always have to be aware of the advance of technology—which this illustrates—and the ability of these terrorist groups to think outside the box. You always, always have to be one step ahead.\" William's helicopter is relatively slow and low-flying, notes the AP. Royal reps had no comment.\n#END SUMMARY"}

She was 88. \n \n Her wife, Judith Kasen-Windsor, confirmed the death, at a hospital, but did not specify a cause. They were married in 2016. \n \n Four decades after the Stonewall Inn uprising fueled the fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in America, Ms. Windsor, the widow of a woman with whom she had lived much of her life, became the lead plaintiff in what is widely regarded as the second most important Supreme Court ruling in the national battle over same-sex marriage rights. \n \n The Windsor decision, handed down in 2013, was limited to 13 states and the District of Columbia. But in a more expansive ruling in 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges and three related cases, the Supreme Court held that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry anywhere in the nation, with all the protections and privileges of heterosexual couples. Its historic significance was likened to that of Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, which decriminalized gay sex in the United States. ||||| Windsor, known for remaining bubbly and upbeat during her legal battle, contested her estate tax liability after the 2009 death of her longtime wife, Thea Spyer, because the U.S. government did not recognize their Canadian marriage.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nEdith Windsor, the woman behind the legal case that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and paved the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage, died Tuesday at 88, the New York Daily News reports. The longtime New Yorker and gay-rights activist was the plaintiff in United States v. Windsor, which went before the Supreme Court in 2013. According to the New York Times, the ruling in favor of Windsor was the first time married same-sex couples received federal recognition. It allowed couples in states where same-sex marriage was already legal to receive more than 1,000 federal benefits available to heterosexual couples and struck down the legal definition of marriage as between a man and woman, paving the way for the 2015 case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. \"The wheels of progress turn forward because of people like Edie who are willing to stand up in the face of injustice,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero says.\n#END SUMMARY"}

One of the passengers contacted the I-Team in disbelief, asking if it was part of a new pre-flight checklist. When this flight attendant ended up working their flight, they took down her name and later found she had posted the pictures on her Facebook page.Some passengers witnessed the flight attendant standing on the tarmac in front of one of the plane's jet engines and then scrunched in front of the turbine blades.One person who contacted the I-Team said they couldn't believe what they were seeing and questioned whether it was proper and legal.They wrote down the name of the Spirit flight attendant, Ericka Paige Diehl, and looked her up on Facebook, where the tarmac photos were posted. One of them was being used as her profile picture.When we contacted her Tuesday, the 41-year-old Gurnee resident said at first that she didn't know anything about the photos on her Facebook page, and then said she wasn't \"at liberty to discuss them.\"A few minutes later, however, the pictures vanished from Facebook and are now replaced by an inspirational message that says, \"Your wings already exist, all you have to do is fly.\" Tonight her Facebook page has been taken down altogether.This afternoon a Spirit Airlines executive did discuss the photos with the I-Team, stating that \"the activity portrayed in the photo absolutely goes against Spirit policy.\"Spirit spokesman Paul Berry said the airline will be investigating further and take appropriate action.After the flight took off from O'Hare, the concerned passenger asked that flight attendant what she was doing around the engines and her reply was \"taking a picture.\" It may end up a picture to remember.A spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Aviation says, \"in order to access the tarmac, an individual must be properly badged and/or under escort.\" It isn't clear whether Diehl or those taking the picture were authorized to be there and she hung up on the I-Team before that could be clarified. Prior to the photos disappearing from her Facebook page, however, in an exchange with friends Diehl did comment that the pictures could probably get her fired. ||||| A Spirit Airlines flight attendant found herself in the middle of a controversy after passengers spotted her posing for photos inside a jet engine. \n \n A passenger saw stewardess Ericka Paige Diehl posing for the photos while passengers boarded a Spirit Airlines flight at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. The passenger took down the flight attendant’s name and contacted ABC station WLS, asking if the photo was part of a new pre-flight checklist. \n \n The passenger then found out that Diehl posted the photos to her Facebook page, WLS reported. \n \n Spirit Airlines said in a statement about the photos, “The activity portrayed in the photo absolutely goes against Spirit policy.” \n \n But for many in the flying community, the outrage over Diehl’s photo shoot is unmerited. Sylvester Pittman, an aviation consultant with Airline Guys and a former flight attendant, said such photos are popular for flight crews. \n \n \"I have a picture in a jet engine, and pretty much everybody that I know that has been a flight attendant ... it’s just one of those things that we like to do,\" Pittman said. \n \n Heather Poole, a flight attendant and author of the New York Times bestseller “Cruising Attitude,” also addressed the issue, writing on Twitter, “The photo of the flight attendant in the engine isn’t a problem. We all take them. The time that she decided to take it could be an issue.” \n \n Diehl did not respond to a request for comment, but told WLS she wasn’t at liberty to discuss the photos. The photos were removed from her Facebook page and replaced with the quote, “Your wings already exist, all you have to do is fly.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPassengers on a recent Spirit Airlines flight out of Chicago who were disturbed by an incident on the tarmac may not want to check out the #stewsforericka hashtag on Twitter. That's because there are loads of photos of flight attendants posing for snapshots in jet engine wells—a show of solidarity for attendant Ericka Paige Diehl, who's in hot water for taking such a photo at O'Hare airport, reports WLS. A passenger who saw her do it before the flight contacted WLS to ask if it was legal. When Diehl came aboard, someone got her name, looked her up online, and saw she had posted those tarmac pictures to her Facebook page. The photos, as well as her entire Facebook page, have since been scrubbed, the station notes. A Chicago Department of Aviation rep tells WLS that anyone on the tarmac has to be \"properly badged and/or under escort.\" And, per ABC News, when Spirit Airlines got wind of the situation, it issued a statement that said, \"The activity portrayed in the photo absolutely goes against Spirit policy.\" A spokesman says an investigation is underway. But fellow professional fliers are supporting Diehl, saying such photos are a time-honored tradition. \"I have a picture in a jet engine, and pretty much everybody that I know that has been a flight attendant … it's just one of those things that we like to do,\" an ex-flight attendant tells ABC. Another tweets: \"The photo of the flight attendant in the engine isn't a problem. We all take them. The time that she decided to take it could be an issue.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIsrael's newly retired spy chief thinks Iran will not be able to build a nuclear bomb before 2015, Israeli media reported Friday _ further pushing back Israeli intelligence estimates of when Tehran might become a nuclear power. \n \n Meir Dagan, who left his post as head of the Mossad intelligence service this week, said Thursday that Iran's nuclear program had been delayed by unspecified \"measures\" employed against it, according to the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot. \n \n Other Israeli media reported Dagan's prediction, citing \"closed conversations\" he held Thursday before leaving his post as head of Israel's covert intelligence arm. \n \n An Israeli government spokesman would not comment Friday. \n \n As recently as 2009, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Iran would be able to build a nuclear bomb by 2011. But since then the projected deadline has been extended. The Israeli Cabinet minister in charge of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, said last week it would take the Iranians at least three years to develop a nuclear weapon. \n \n The assessment by Dagan adds another year to that estimate. Dagan also said Israel \"should not hurry to attack\" Iran, according to the Yediot Ahronot report. \n \n Israel officially supports the diplomatic efforts in place to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, but has not ruled out the possibility of a military strike. \n \n Iran claims its nuclear program is aimed at producing electricity, but Israel, many of Iran's Arab neighbors, the U.S. and other Western countries are convinced the Iranian program is aimed at producing weapons. \n \n Iran has blamed Israel for disruptions in its nuclear program. In November, assailants on motorcycles attached magnetized bombs to the cars of two Iranian nuclear scientists as they drove to work in Tehran, killing one and wounding another. At least two other Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in recent years. \n \n In addition, a computer worm known as Stuxnet is thought to have caused the Iranians serious technical problems in the centrifuges used for uranium enrichment _ a process that can be used both to produce reactor fuel and material for nuclear warheads. \n \n Tehran's nuclear program is of particular concern to Israel, which sees a nuclear weapon in Iranian hands as an existential threat. Iran funds Islamic militant groups on Israel's borders, such as the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has said Israel should be \"wiped off the map.\" \n \n The U.N. Security Council imposed four rounds of sanctions on Iran after Tehran refused to halt its program. The council's five permanent members, along with Germany, are set to hold a new round of talks with Iran in late January. \n \n Iran recently invited Hungary, which currently holds the rotating European Union presidency, Russia, China and other countries to tour its nuclear sites before those talks. It pointedly did not invite the U.S. or other Western powers on the Security Council. ||||| BERLIN—International talks with Iran over its nuclear program are set to resume in Istanbul on January 20, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said. \n \n The participants—Russia, China, the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Iran—are still working on an agenda for the discussions, which are scheduled to begin the evening of Jan. 20 and last at least through Jan. 21, the spokeswoman said. \n \n The goal of the international powers going into the talks is to convince Iran to take steps toward abandoning its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. and its allies believe Iran is using what it claims is a civilian nuclear ...\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIsrael shouldn't rush to attack Iran because Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is still four years away from developing a nuclear weapon, says the newly retired spy chief of Mossad. He claims that certain \"measures\" have pushed back Tehran's timetable a few years, reports AP. He didn't say what those measures were exactly, but Iran is pretty sure Israel is behind the Stuxnet worm and an attack on two of its scientists. On another front, international talks with Iran about its nuclear ambitions resume Jan. 20, notes the Wall Street Journal.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Johnson and Michael Perry) ||||| Jul 1, 2014 8:26 PM by Marissa Esquivel \n \n Yavapai County man accused of animal cruelty to rats \n \n YAVAPAI COUNTY - A Yavapai County man has been arrested and charged with animal cruelty charges. \n \n On Monday, Yavapai County Health Services got a call from a citizen reporting numerous dying and dead rats in and around a trailer on the property. \n \n When deputies arrived, they immediately smelled urine, feces and dead animal carcass' emanating from the property. \n \n The trailer had a cage in the front section with several dead rats. Other cages near the end of the trailer had 300-500 rats, most of which where dead. \n \n Inside the main house, deputies found aquariums with newborn and adult rats, which appeared to be in good condition. \n \n Sheriff deputies said the temperature inside the trailer was over 100 degrees and the odor was overwhelming. \n \n Deputies were able to determine that 28-year-old Jeffrey Wendorff was the caretaker of rats. He was located at a nearby business and detained. \n \n Wendorff first denied any knowledge of animals on the property. Eventually, he admitted that he had stopped caring for the rats. \n \n Wendorff said he was living at the location until a couple of weeks ago. Both he and the property owner had previously entered into a business partnership, breeding and selling rats. Wendorff told duputies that the arrangement allowed him to live on the property for free. Following a money dispute, Wendorff abandoned his duty as the primary caretaker, moved, and abandoned the animals. \n \n Wendorff was arrested and charged with Cruel Mistreatment of Animals and Cruel Neglect/Abandonment of Animal, both misdemeanors. He was booked at the Camp Verde Detention Center and has since been released on a promise to appear for court.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIt was a scene whose appearance was likely rivaled only by its smell: An Arizona man is facing animal cruelty charges after Yavapai County sheriff’s deputies, acting on a tip, discovered scores of dead or dying rats in and around a trailer, Reuters reports; a pen in the trailer's rear contained as many as 500 rats. Roughly a quarter were dead, said a sheriff’s department rep. When they and animal control officers arrived at the scene Monday, deputies were welcomed by the \"overwhelming\" stench of feces, urine, and decomposition, adds KVOA; the temperature inside the trailer was reportedly over 100 degrees. Newborn and adult rats found in a number of aquariums that contained food and water appeared fine, reports the Arizona Republic. Jeffrey Wendorff, 28, who according to KVOA initially denied that he knew about the rats’ presence, was arrested on suspicion of cruel mistreatment of animals and cruel neglect and abandonment of an animal. Deputies say he ultimately admitted that he lived on the property rent-free in exchange for breeding the rats, but that his relationship with the property owner soured over money, causing him to take off a couple weeks ago, leaving the animals to their own devices. \"As far as I know, (the rats are) probably all dead,” he told deputies.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nsplenic torsion of the so called wandering spleen is an extremely rare phenomenon, having an incidence of 1 in 2000 and accounts for only 2 per 1000 splenectomies . \n an 18 year old married female patient presented to the obstetrics and gynaecology emergency unit with severe pain and abdominal distension for one day . there was no history of vomiting, constipation or fever . \n her period was overdue by about 40 days when she presented in the emergency department . \n she was found to be very pale and was haemodynamically unstable with an uncordable blood pressure . \n her abdomen was distended and tender, without any significant rebound tenderness . per rectal examination was normal . \n per vaginal examination showed a bulky uterus, a distended pouch of douglas and adnexae were found to be apparently normal . \n as emergency ultrasonographic or other imaging facility was not available at that time a culdocentesis was done which revealed haemoperitoneum . \n as patient was deteriorating rapidly, an urgent laparotomy was done with a provisional diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy . \n she was found to have about 2 litres of dark coloured blood with clots in her abdomen . \n examination of the pelvis revealed normal fallopian tubes and ovaries but the uterus was bulky . \n a hugely enlarged and congested spleen, transversely oriented was found with multiple ruptures on its surface . \n the hilum and splenic pedicle could not be identified initially as the spleen had rotated three and a half times on its pedicle . \n two units of blood were transfused peri - operatively and two units post - operatively . \n no tumour mass or any other significant pathology was found . on day 3 post - op, \n she further underwent a check curettage for evacuation of retained products of conception . following this, the patient made a full recovery \n splenic torsion with spontaneous rupture in a patient with early intrauterine pregnancy is an extremely rare cause of acute abdomen . \n the diagnosis is extremely difficult as seen in the case where it masqueraded as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy . \n the exact aetiology is unknown but it is probably due to incomplete fixation of gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments which gives rise to the so called wandering spleen . ( 3 ) presentation is highly variable and there are reports of this entity presenting as an acute abdomen, abdominal mass or even as intestinal obstruction . \n the acquired form is usually seen in multiparous women possibly as a result of hormonal changes in pregnancy that cause laxity of the abdominal wall and the ligaments attached to the spleen . \n ( 7,8 ) splenomegaly has been known to elongate the splenic pedicle by traction, increasing preponderance to torsion and splenoptosis . \n ( 9 ) torsion may then cause venous congestion, further splenomegaly, elongation of vascular pedicle and splenoptosis . as the condition is very rare \n often there is not enough time for radiological investigations but if possible a ct scan or ultrasound should be done . \n this report brings out the importance of considering splenic torsion in the differential diagnosis of all cases of acute abdomen, particularly when we do not have the time or facility to carry out a full radiological evaluation .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nSplenic torsion with rupture of spleen is an extremely rare phenomenon . \n the clinical picture mimics several common conditions which are causes of acute abdomen and so it is seldom detected pre - operatively . \n an 18 year old female patient was admitted with an acute abdomen and shock . \n the provisional diagnosis was of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy . \n peri - operatively we found a spontaneous rupture of the spleen following torsion along with early intrauterine pregnancy . \n splenectomy was carried out and patient recovered well . \n our report confirms that this rare entity can present as an acute abdomen which is very difficult to diagnose preoperatively and can masquerade as ruptured ectopic pregnancy in women of childbearing age group .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe video will start in 8 Cancel \n \n Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Yum.\" \n \n But viewers sensed something was wrong when she added: \"Oh, that's bitter. That is really bitter.\" \n \n (Image: Asiawire) \n \n Zhang, who is still recovering in hospital, later claimed her mouth went \"numb\" and she felt like her throat was \"on fire\". \n \n She also \"lost her voice\" after three bites of the agave Americana and immediately took herself to hospital, abandoning the live stream entirely. \n \n Doctors found that she had also been suffering from severe rashes and blisters, and later pumped her stomach to remove the harmful substances from her body. ||||| One woman has managed to win internet fame, though not exactly in the way that she had hoped after being forced to abruptly end her live stream and rush herself to the hospital after discovering that the plant she was eating was not what she thought it was. \n \n To prepare for her live stream, the 26-year-old woman surnamed Zhang had bought two waxy green leaves that she thought were aloe vera, a plant purported to have various health benefits when eaten raw. \n \n After taking her first bite, Zhang exclaims, \"This is great!\" However, upon taking her second bite, she begins to realize that something is terribly wrong. \"Oh, that tastes bitter. Really bitter,\" she says to the camera. \n \n It turns out that what Zhang was chomping down on was not aloe vera, but Agave Americana (American aloe), a poisonous plant from Mexico that is very not edible. Zhang said that just one bite made her mouth go numb and her throat feel like it was on fire. \n \n At the hospital, doctors found that Zhang had broken out into rashes and blisters and were forced to pump her stomach to remove parts of the poisonous plant and save her life. She is reported to be in stable condition. \n \n [Images via Oriental Daily / h/t Asia One]\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA Chinese woman was live-streaming herself eating what she thought was aloe vera (said to have health benefits when eaten raw) when she abruptly realized something was very wrong. It turns out the 26-year-old, named in the media only as Zhang, was actually eating Agave Americana or \"American aloe,\" a poisonous plant from Mexico, Shanghaiist reports. Though video of the woman shows her initially proclaiming the first bite as \"great,\" Zhang quickly changed her tune, proclaiming the plant \"really bitter.\" She later said her mouth went numb and her throat started burning, the Mirror reports. She ended up rushing herself to the hospital, having broken out in rashes and blisters, and doctors reportedly had to pump her stomach to save her life.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Props like sports and military equipment will be banned, as well as flags or signs that are wider than 11 inches and longer than 17 inches. \n \n Bags, used in the past by runners to carry clothes and other personal items, will be banned on the buses that carry runners from Boston Common to Hopkinton, where the race starts. And no bags will be brought by those buses back to Boston. \n \n Instead, runners can check bags with personal items on Boston Common, take the bus to Hopkinton, run back, and then retrieve their bags. \n \n Runners can carry fanny packs and fuel belts. \n \n The association said there would be changes to the finish line, including three areas just before Arlington Street where runners and others can exit. “More information on these exit areas will be forthcoming,” the e-mail said. \n \n The new restrictions also boded ill for “bandits” — the unauthorized runners who join the race every year. The rules said that this year bandits would be “subject to interdiction.” \n \n “We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year’s Boston Marathon as a display of support, but we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves,” the e-mail said. \n \n “Similarly, units or groups such as military ruck-marchers and cyclists, which have sometimes joined on course, will not be allowed to participate,” the e-mail said. \n \n “For the 2014 Boston Marathon, with an increased field size and for everyone’s safety, we will work with public safety officials to ensure that we preserve the exceptional race day experience that makes the Boston Marathon an icon in the world of sport while making race day safe and enjoyable for all,” the e-mail said. \n \n The last running of the Marathon — normally an upbeat celebration of world-class athletes’ prowess and average runners’ determination — turned tragic when twin terror bombs went off near the finish line. The explosions killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. One suspect in the bombings is dead and the other is awaiting a federal trial that could bring him the death penalty. ||||| The Boston Athletic Association has indicated it will crack down on bandit runners and even ROTC marchers who don’t have registration numbers, according to an email released today that also bans participants from bringing bags to this year’s Boston Marathon as part of higher security measures following the 2013 bombings. \n \n \n \n The article you requested has been archived All coverage within bostonherald.com from the last 14 days remains free of charge.

According to a mass email sent out yesterday, the following are all forbidden this year: Bulky clothes, or costumes that conceal a runner's face Strollers at the start or finish line Backpacks, CamelBaks, and the bags runners often use to carry clothes and personal effects Glass containers Suitcases and rolling bags Vests with pockets, except lightweight running vests Props, including sports and military equipment Flags or signs wider than 11\" or longer than 17\" The race will be also cracking down on \"bandits,\" the thousands of unauthorized runners who always jump into the action. The BAA said that anyone without an official number would be \"subject to interdiction.\" That would include, the Boston Herald notes, the dozens of ROTC cadets who traditionally march in the race. A spokesman said the BAA hasn't decided yet whether to make an exception for the marchers.\n#END SUMMARY"}

There were obvious leaks, but they weren't from the White House.\" \n \n Axelrod said Obama takes all \"life or death decisions\" on national security seriously, and that the White House would not leak information that may jeopardize classified operations. \n \n \"He understands that when he commits people to missions that their lives are at stake, and the safety of Americans are at stake,\" Axelrod said. \"And the last thing that he would countenance or anybody around him would countenance are leaks that would jeopardize the security of Americans on these secret missions, and the success of those missions.\" \n \n Both Republicans and Democrats have accused the White House of releasing details of various secret operations, including the effort to sabotage Iran's nuclear program, for political purposes in order to bolster President Obama's national security credentials before the election. \n \n President Obama disputed that charge Friday at a White House press conference, saying, \"The notion that my White House would purposefully release classified national security information is offensive. It's wrong.\" \n \n Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday that two federal prosecutors would lead investigations into the leaks to news outlets, including The New York Times. \n \n When I asked if he was confident the investigations would not show White House involvement, Axelrod said \"Yes,\" citing the administration's history of cracking down on leaks. \n \n \"We have come under attack because we have been tougher on leaks than any administration in recent history And we have been criticized for that,\" Axelrod said. \"We want to make sure that the people we assign to these very difficult tasks are safe, or as safe as they can be.\" ||||| Two stories published by the New York Times, which exposed the extent of U.S. involvement in cyber attacks against Iran and the White House’s secret 'Kill List,' have sparked scrutiny over the last week amid allegations that administration officials had leaked classified information for political gain.The debate continued Sunday as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reiterated calls for a special prosecutor to take charge of leak investigations and as a reporter who wrote one of the stories said he doubted that any politically motivated leaks were involved.David Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for the New York Times, appeared on CNN ’s “Reliable Sources” to defend his reporting on U.S. involvement in deploying the Stuxnet computer virus against Iran.Sanger said that during 18 months of reporting for his book “Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,” he obtained information from the ground up. He said he had serious doubts as to whether there were any political motivations behind the leaks.“Did I talk to a lot of people in the administration? Of course,” he said, as would be expected when writing a book about national security.Sanger contended that how Obama conducts himself in the theater of international military action is key for the public to know, and is a necessary story for the media to report on, regardless of the secrecy associated with national security issues.“Can we debate them out in the open? Of course,” he said.McCain dismissed Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder ’s appointment of two federal prosecutors to oversee the investigation.“Mr. Holder’s credibility with Congress, there is none. We continue to have this problem with him withholding information on Fast and Furious, which resulted in the killing of a border patrol agent in Arizona. He is close to being held in contempt,” McCain said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House committee investigating the Fast and Furious operation – an effort to track gun purchases by Mexican drug cartels that lost track of many of the weapons – has proposed holding Holder in contempt. Democrats have dismissed the effort as political grandstanding.“This information had to have come from the administration. It couldn’t have come from anywhere else,” McCain said, referring to details in Sanger’s book. “The president may not have done it himself, but he’s certainly responsible as commander in chief.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe public's right to know about the president and his policies outweigh secrecy and security issues, says David Sanger, the New York Times reporter behind one of two much-criticized articles on the White House's approach to national security, reports the LA Times. Sen. John McCain has repeatedly attacked the White House for leaking sensitive information to boost its profile, specifically via Sanger's story about the president's role in stepping up cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program. But Sanger, who is coming out with a book about national security under President Obama, titled Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, says those issues are fair game and important for the press—but, of course, he doesn't reveal his sources. “Did I talk to a lot of people in the administration? Of course,” said Sanger, without naming names. “Can we debate\" the issues \"out in the open? Of course.” President Obama's senior campaign adviser, meanwhile, continued to defend the White House from leak accusations, telling ABC News that the administration would not compromise national security. “I can’t say that there weren’t leaks,\" said David Axelrod. \"There were obvious leaks, but they weren’t from the White House.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\n( 2s,4r)-1-tert - butyl 2-methyl 4-hydroxypyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate \n ( 5.00 g, 20.4 mmol ) was dissolved in anhydrous ch2cl2 ( 200 ml ) at room temperature under n2 . to the \n solution \n were added 4-nitrobenzoic acid ( 3.41 g, 20.4 mmol ) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide \n ( dcc ) ( 5.06 g, 24.5 mmol ) . \n a catalytic amount of n, n-(dimethylamino)pyridine ( dmap ) ( 125 mg, 1.0 mmol ) was added to the \n reaction mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously \n for 12 h. the white precipitate was filtered, and the solvent was \n removed in vacuo . \n the resulting crude oil was purified by silica gel \n column chromatography ( 02% ch3oh / ch2cl2 v / v ) to yield compound 1 ( 6.1 g ) as a \n colorless oil ( 76% yield ) . \n the minor cis rotational \n isomer was distinctly observed for a few resonances : h \n nmr ( 600 mhz, cdcl3 )  8.328.30 ( d, j = 8.8 hz, 2h ), 8.208.18 ( d, j = 8.7 hz, 2h ), 5.585.57 ( m, 1h ), 4.564.52 ( t, j = 7.8 hz, minor ), 4.474.43 ( t, j = 8.1 hz, major ) ( sum of major and minor = 1h ), 3.913.85 \n ( m, 1h ), 3.79 ( s, minor ), 3.78 ( s, major ) ( sum of major and minor \n = 3h ), 3.733.70 ( m, 1h ), 2.612.58 ( m, 1h ), 2.402.32 \n ( m, 1h ), 1.47 ( s, minor ), and 1.44 ( s, major ) ( sum of major and minor \n = 9h ) ; c nmr ( 151 mhz, cdcl3 )  173.0, \n 164.4, 153.9, 151.1, 135.2, 131.2, 124.0, 81.2, 74.7, 74.0, 58.2, \n 52.7, 36.9, and 28.6 ; esi ms : [ m + na ] calcd for c18h22n2o8na 417.1, found 417.0 ; \n hrms ( lifdi - tof ) m / z [ m ] calcd for c18h22n2o8 394.1376 ; fragments observed : [ m  c7h5no4 ] calcd for c11h17no4 227.1158, found 227.1146 ( loss of nitrobenzoate ) ; \n [ m  c7h3no3 ] calcd for c11h19no5 245.1263, found \n 245.1234 ( loss of nitrobenzoyl ) ( major fragment ) ; [ m  c5h8o2 ] calcd for \n c13h14n2o6 294.0852, found \n 294.0865 ( loss of boc ) ( second most prominent fragment ) . \n compound 1 ( 3.4 g, 8.6 \n mmol ) was dissolved in anhydrous ch2cl2 ( 20 \n ml ) under a nitrogen atmosphere . \n trifluoroacetic acid ( cf3cooh ) ( 20 ml ) was added to the solution, and the resulting reaction \n mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. the solvent was removed \n in vacuo . \n the crude oil thus obtained was washed with cold ether ( 3 \n  15 ml ) to obtain compound 2 ( 1.8 g ) as a white \n solid ( 74% yield ) : h nmr ( 600 mhz, d2o )  \n 8.468.37 ( d, j = 7.2 hz, 2h ), 8.348.28 \n ( d, j = 7.1 hz, 2h ), 5.77 ( m, 1h ), 4.874.82 \n ( m, 1h ), 4.614.54 ( m, 1h ), 3.903.74 ( m, 2h ), \n 2.902.84 \n ( m, 1h ), and 2.682.64 ( m, 1h ) ; c nmr ( 151 mhz, \n d2o / dmso - d6 ( 9:1 ) )  \n 171.2, 162.2, 153.1, 137.4, 133.9, 126.3, 76.8, 60.1, 55.8, 53.2, \n and 36.7 ; hrms ( lifdi - tof ) m / z [ m \n + h ] calcd for c12h13n2o6 281.0774, found 281.0763 . \n crystals were obtained from the \n slow evaporation of a solution of approximately 10 mg of compound 2 in 500 l of d2o ( table 3 ) . \n the absolute \n structure parameter refined to nil indicating the true hand of the \n data had been determined consistent with \n known chiral centers . \n the structure was solved \n using direct methods and refined with full - matrix, least - squares procedures \n on f. all non - hydrogen atoms were refined \n with anisotropic displacement parameters . \n four symmetry unique molecules \n of the zwitterion and four water molecules of hydration were located \n in the asymmetric unit . \n the water and ammonium h atoms were located \n from the difference map and treated with x  h and h \n all other hydrogen atoms were treated as idealized \n contributions with geometrically calculated positions and with uiso equal to 1.2, or 1.5 for methyl, ueq of the attached atom . \n the methylene h atom \n torsion angles were derived from the refined c  c bond positions \n and assuming idealized tetrahedral sp geometry . \n structural information has been deposited with \n the cambridge crystallographic data centre under deposition no .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\n( 2s,4r)-4-hydroxyproline(4-nitrobenzoate ) \n was synthesized . \n the crystal structure revealed an exo ring pucker, \n with the nitrobenzoate pseudoaxial on the pyrrolidine envelope and \n antiperiplanar to c and c c \n h \n bonds . \n the unit cell exhibited variation in ch / co and ch / co torsion angles, with a 15 increase in torsion angle \n ( 148 to 163 ) observed to result in a 0.018  decrease \n in ch / co bond \n length, consistent with favorable c \n h \n *c  o hyperconjugative interactions increasing \n with greater orbital overlap .\n#END SUMMARY"}

(Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) \n \n Chris Stapleton won the most awards at the 2018 Country Music Association Awards and had the show's best performance, almost capping a perfect night. \n \n That was until Keith Urban surprisingly won the top prize — entertainer of the year — moments before the three-hour show wrapped Wednesday night. \n \n Urban's actress-wife, Nicole Kidman, was in tears as the singer walked onstage to collect the award at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. \n \n \"Baby girl, I love you so much,\" he said. \"I'm shocked beyond shocked.\" \n \n Urban last won entertainer of the year in 2005 and also beat out Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Kenny Chesney for the prize. \n \n \"I wish my dad was alive to see this,\" the Australian performer said. \n \n Stapleton, however, cleaned house at the CMAs, winning four awards including male vocalist, song and single of the year. \n \n \"I want to thank my kids who put up with me being gone quite a bit and not getting to be as a good daddy that I would always like to be,\" said the father of four and soon to be five since his wife, singer-songwriter Morgane Stapleton, is pregnant. \n \n Stapleton also won the performance of the night: His supergroup featuring Mavis Staples, Maren Morris, Marty Stuart and his wife gave a soulful and powerful performance of \"Friendship,\" a song made famous by Pop Staples, the iconic singer's late father. They then performed \"I'll Take You There,\" jamming onstage along with a choir. They earned a standing ovation from the audience. \n \n When Stapleton won single of the year — where he won as both a performer and producer — earlier in the show, he said he was \"thinking about the people in California right now\" and he wants to \"dedicate this award to them.\" \n \n He was referring to the 12 people who were killed at a Southern California country music bar last week, who were also honored at the top of the show when Garth Brooks held a moment of silence as the names of the victims were displayed on the screen. \n \n \"Tonight let's celebrate their lives. Let the music unite us with love,\" Brooks said. \n \n The CMAs, which aired on ABC, also took time to honor those affected by the deadly wildfires in California. \n \n \"We send our love to you,\" said Carrie Underwood, also mentioning the \"brave firefighters.\" \n \n Underwood worked triple-duty as co-host, performer and nominee at the CMAs. She was teary-eyed when she won female vocalist of the year. \n \n \"Thank you God. I have been blessed with so much in my life,\" she said. \"Thank you family. Thank you country music. Thank you country music family. ...It's all about family around here.\" \n \n She kept the positive and uplifting theme of the show going when she gave a rousing performance of her song \"Love Wins.\" It features the lyrics, \"I believe you and me are sisters and brothers/And I believe we're made to be here for each other.\" \n \n Kacey Musgraves, the only woman nominated for album of the year, won the prize for \"Golden Hour.\" \n \n \"This is really, really crazy timing — 10 years ago today I moved to Nashville. That's so crazy,\" she said. \n \n \"I'm so proud of it,\" she said of the pop-leaning country album, which was inspired by Sade, the Bee Gees and others. \"It's inspired by this beautiful universe, and all of you, and mostly love.\" \n \n Dan + Shay lost in all four categories they were nominated in but gave an impressive performance of their hit \"Tequila.\" When Brothers Osborne won vocal duo of the year, John Osborne said, \"I thought this was going to go to Dan + Shay. Make some noise for those boys.\" \n \n \"I don't know why we keep winning this,\" John Osborne said when he first walked onstage. \n \n \"If this was in Florida there definitely would be a recount,\" added T.J. Osborne, which earned laughs from the crowd. \n \n Luke Combs, who has the year's most-streamed country music album, sang onstage with a red cup in his hand and won new artist of the year. \n \n \"God, I love country music, man,\" said Combs. \n \n Brooks performed a touching new song dedicated to his wife, Trisha Yearwood, who was teary-eyed and was hearing the song for the first time. Recent Country Hall of Famer Ricky Skaggs performed alongside Brad Paisley and Urban. \n \n Underwood and Paisley returned as CMA hosts for the 11th time this year, telling jokes at the top of the show, which ranged from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's \"A Star Is Born\" to Underwood's pregnancy. \n \n Underwood seemingly revealed a secret about the child, saying it will be a \"Willie\" after Paisley repeatedly asked about the sex of the baby.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nChris Stapleton won the most awards at the 2018 Country Music Association Awards and had the show's best performance, almost capping a perfect night.

The Haltom City mom and dad and their three children had just completed a drive-through of the Christmas lights extravaganza at Texas Motor Speedway and were on their way home \"in their car singing Christmas carols,\" the deceased's aunt tells the station. \"My sister said within seconds everything turned to chaos.\" That chaos came in the form of a Ford Explorer that smashed into the back of the family's car, killing 23-year-old Alexander Trejo and his 19-year-old sister, Gabrielle Estelle. The local medical examiner says the two victims, who had to be pulled from their Ford Fusion, died of blunt force trauma, per the Star-Telegram. \"We were laughing, giggling, singing Christmas songs, and then the next thing I know is I blacked out,\" 17-year-old Zachary, the sole surviving sibling, tells Fox 4 News. Zachary's parents were both hospitalized after the accident with injuries that were said to be non-life-threatening, per a GoFundMe page set up by the mom's co-workers. Fort Worth police are still trying to figure out what caused the Ford Explorer to plow into the family's car, WFAA reports; as of now, the driver of the SUV isn't facing any criminal charges. Meanwhile, family and friends held a tribute Wednesday night for Alexander, who had a love of music, and Gabrielle, said to be an aspiring photographer, Fox 4 News notes. The GoFundMe page has so far raised more than $9,000 for the family's hospital and funeral expenses.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nthe biomedical community has established the standards of good clinical practice as the cornerstone of medical research on humans . \n what are the standards for studying practices that overtly and intention ally fall short of good practice and are clearly discriminatory against the aged ? \n i find four ethical problems in the study on ventilated patients outside the intensive care unit ( icu ) . \n had this been an interventional study, omission of informed consent would have been unthinkable . \n but, unfortunately, in that hospital, and in many others, these patients would have been sent anyway to a medical floor . in some other countries \n, they would not have been ventilated at all unless an icu bed was secured for them in advance . \n the fundamental difference between the icu and a regular hospital floor lies in the capacity to monitor and to react . \n is it not likely that when an icu person collects all sorts of data on the participants, issues come to attention - such as wrong ventilator settings, a need for a different drug, and so forth ? \n intervention is incompatible with the methodology of the study ; non - intervention is grossly immoral . \n moreover, since icu beds might become available and patients might deteriorate, ventilated patients who can not be admitted to the icu on the day of hospitalization deserve reassessment for admittance later on . interestingly, no study patient was transferred from the medical floor to the icu . \n a third problem is related to the fact that in israel, as well as in many other places, the decision of whether to admit a patient to the icu is solely in the hands of icu doctors . \n it follows that this research was conducted in order to evaluate the safety of gatekeeping by the very people who serve as the sole gatekeepers . \n i wish the ethics committee of soroka hospital had set some provisory guidelines for triage and for care of ventilated patients in the medical floors prior to that hospital 's institutional review board 's endorsement of this non - interventional study . \n the authors themselves testify to their deviation from established ethical norms : the recommendation that ' chronological age per se is not a relevant criterion for hospitalization in an icu '   was not substantiated in the present study population . \n what the authors actually say is that the icu team in their hospital violates professional ethical guidelines protecting a vulnerable population, without any sort of reflection or policy endorsement . \n a study conducted in the united kingdom found that 12% of icu patients could be cared for in a regular ward and 53% of ward patients were better suited for icu care . \n healthcare expenditure, which is an explicit concern in the article, did not correlate with availability and accessibility of intensive care services . \n a meta - analysis of numerous clinical publications from all over the world has found age to be a factor in the triage of patients for critical care . \n the number of icu beds per capita varies substantially from one place to another, and a low bed / population ratio correlates with increased inhospital mortality overall . \n perhaps ageism rears its head when the ratio of icu beds to population is low, as is the case in israel . \n deliberate rationing of scarce health resources on the basis of age is highly controversial . like any other form of rationing \n, it depends on open deliberation for justification and legitimization, and not on inconclusive evidence and a motivation to save money . \n a serious confounding factor in the whole discourse on the allocation of intensive care is lack of clarity regarding the prognosis of ventilated patients . \n for some, icu care is plainly futile - but legal and psychosocial issues do not allow doctors to disconnect . \n a second group of patients is also sent to the regular floor, however, not because they do not need intensive care but because the person responsible for the icu does not have a bed for them . in the absence of conceptual differentiation of patients who need icu care from those for whom \n such care is futile, little may be said about the overall outcome in terms of mortality . \n those who are accustomed to seeing ventilated patients on the medical floors are not surprised to learn that more than one - quarter of them survived despite non - icu standards of care . \n doctors who avoid intubation of patients that have no chance of entry into the icu may reconsider this policy . in my eyes, this is the most important lesson to take from this publication . \n my second take - home message is that ageism is still prevalent in healthcare and clinical research . \n policy - makers should deliberate more openly the role of age in distributive justice in healthcare, while boosting awareness of existing ethical guidelines and of every doctor 's commitment to protect the vulnerable .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nFour ethical issues loom over the study by lieberman and colleagues - the absence of informed consent, the study being non - interventional in situations that typically call for life - saving interventions, the bias involved in doctors that study their own problematic practice and monopoly over intensive care unit triage, and ageism . \n we learn that the israeli doctors in this study never make no - treatment decisions regarding patients in need of mechanical ventilation . \n they are complicit with botched standards of care for these patients, however, accepting without much doubt an ethos of scarce resources and poor managerial habits . \n the main two practical lessons to be taken from this study are that, for patients in need of mechanical ventilation, compromised care is better than a policy of intubation only when the intensive care unit is available, and that vigorous efforts are needed in order to extirpate ageism .\n#END SUMMARY"}

Wesley had returned to the holding area and apparently tried to see what was happening to the giraffe. \n \n The staff was able to dislodge him within a few minutes, officials said, but by that time, it was too late to prevent significant damage. \n \n “They tried for several hours with different types of medications, different types of supportive therapy, but it was a consistent and dramatic decline and eventually a very difficult decision had to be made to euthanize him,” said Magill. \n \n The injury prevented him from being able to stand and maintain equilibrium. \n \n If a giraffe can’t stand up, it can’t survive, Magill told Scouten. \n \n “He was falling over. They went as far as to use a sling to try to get him up to support him with a sling to maintain his weight and it got progressively worse. It was just horrific,” said Magill. \n \n A necropsy will be performed Wednesday to find out the extent of the injury. \n \n Wesley was the 48th giraffe born at the zoo. As for the accident, it’s the first of its kind in the zoo’s history. \n \n Zoo staff said they are making modifications around the zoo to prevent an accident like this from happening again. \n \n “Since then, we had a welder come out. We’ve closed every possible gap. We’ve blanketed the entire zoo to make sure something like that cannot happen in a similar way,” said Magill.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nStaff at Zoo Miami are mourning the loss of a juvenile giraffe that had to be put down Tuesday after the 7-month-old got his head stuck in a fence. Wesley the giraffe poked his head into a 10-inch gap in a chain link fence on Tuesday, toward where another giraffe was having a routine exam, but panicked when he couldn't get it out again, zoo rep Ron Magill tells the Miami Herald. As Wesley tried to pull his head out, he lost his footing, causing serious injury to his neck. Zoo staff freed the giraffe's head in minutes, but Wesley couldn't stand, even with the help of a sling. Zoo staff \"tried for several hours with different types of medications, different types of supportive therapy,\" Magill tells CBS Miami. But \"it became painfully obvious that he'd done a traumatic injury, probably to his spinal cord.\" \"I've been here for 36 years; we've never had an incident like this,\" Magill adds. \"It was just horrific.\" Staff have since blocked the hole in the fence and sealed similar openings elsewhere in the zoo so such an accident \"won't happen again,\" Magill says.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDonald Trump’s tweet was a tacit attack on House Speaker Paul Ryan. | Getty Trump: 'It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me' \n \n Donald Trump celebrated his freedom from the Republican establishment Tuesday, boasting that it’s “so nice” to be unchained. \n \n Trump’s tweet was a tacit attack on House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom the Republican nominee has continued to lash out at since the top elected Republican on Monday told his conference he would no longer defend Trump. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,” Trump tweeted. \n \n The real estate mogul also highlighted the chasm in the Republican Party, conceding that Democrats are “far more loyal” than the GOP.

But in the wake of recent denouncements from dozens of Republicans, including Paul Ryan, \"the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\" he said, per Politico. In what is widely viewed as evidence of a widening rift in the Republican Party, Trump went on to bash Ryan as a \"very weak and ineffective leader\" and label Democrats—\"with the exception of cheating Bernie\"—as \"far more loyal to each other\" than Republicans. \"Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!\" he continued, adding, Republicans \"are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary.\" Bustle's take: Trump's \"going rogue and it could get scary.\" In response, a rep says Ryan \"is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same,\" per USA Today. Despite several GOP members calling on Trump to remove himself from the presidential race, the nominee vowed Tuesday to teach Republicans \"how to win.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

odontogenic lesion arising from the nasopalatine duct, which probably originates from the epithelial remnants of the nasopalatine duct stimulated to proliferate by trauma, infection, or mucous retention . \n ndc, also known as incisor canal cyst, nasopalatine canal cyst, nasopalatine cyst or median palate cyst, is the most common non - odontogenic cyst in the maxilla, occurs in 1% of the population, and is most common in middle age . \n since ndc is not a tumor, simple marsupialization to the nasal cavity is another treatment option . \n we treated a 29-year - old male with ndc by endoscopic endonasal marsupialization from the bilateral nasal cavities . \n a 29-year - old male with pain in the palate was referred to our department . he had no history of maxillofacial trauma, or genetic disorders . \n computed tomography showed an eggshaped round radiolucent area on the midline of the maxilla ( figure 1a - c ) . \n sagittal t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a high intensity area in the nasopalatine duct ( figure 1d ) . \n bulging of the corner of the nasal septum and nasal floor was seen only on the right side ( figure 2a, b ) . \n the mucoperiosteal flap was elevated and the bone exposed ( figure 2c, d ) . \n the cyst wall facing the nasal cavity was resected whereas the cyst wall facing palate was preserved . \n although the pain had disappeared postoperatively, the patient noticed paresthesia of the upper incisor area . \n recently, three cases of ndc were treated with endoscopic endonasal marsupialization but had no paresthesia after endoscopic surgery . \n previously, ndc was treated with external incision so that some paresthesia was considered to be a common postoperative sequela and was not a matter of concern . \n the nasopalatine duct contains the nasopalatine nerve and the terminal branch of the descending palatine artery . \n the nasopalatine nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, which passes through the pterygopalatine ganglion, enters the sphenopalatine foramen, and passes medially across the roof of the nose to the upper part of the posterior border of the nasal septum, then passes forward in the mucous membrane of the nasal septum, slopes down to and passes through the incisor canal to reach the hard palate ( figure 3 ) . \n the upper incisor area is co - innervated with the nasopalatine nerve and anterior palatine nerve . \n blocking of the anterior palatine nerve did not change either light touch or pinprick threshold . \n our patient treated with endoscopic endonasal surgery suffered from long - lasting paresthesia of the upper incisor region . \n the previous three cases treated by endoscopic endonasal marsupialization were apparently fenestrated from only one side . to reduce the possibility of stenosis of fenestration, we chose bilateral fenestration to open the ndc as far as possible . \n the orifices of two lateral canals are present on the nasal floor side, which descend and merge to form the main canal that opens on the hard palate as a single nasopalatine foramen ( figure 3 ) . \n unilateral damage of nasopalatine nerve may not cause any sensory abnormality but damage of both nerves may result in paresthesia . since the sensory innervation of the upper incisor region is not exclusively served by the nasopalatine nerve but also by the anterior palatine nerve, complete loss of sensation may not occur . \n this single case report does not establish how the likelihood of paresthesia after bilateral marsupialization of ndc, but this complication is possible after damage to the bilateral nasopalatine nerves . in conclusion, endoscopic endonasal fenestration of ndc is a simple and less invasive treatment . however, bilateral fenestration of the ndc carries the risk of injury to the bilateral nasopalatine nerves on the surface of the ndc, resulting in paresthesia of the upper incisor region . \n we recommend thorough investigation of the surface of the cyst wall and preservation of nerve fibers during this procedure .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nNasopalatine duct cysts are the most common non - odontogenic cysts in the maxilla, and are conventionally treated through a sublabial or palatine approach . recently \n, the endoscopic approach has been used, but experience is extremely limited . \n we treated a 29-year - old male with nasopalatine duct cyst by endoscopic marsupialization, but paresthesia of the incisor region occurred after surgery . \n this paresthesia gradually remitted within 6 months . \n the nasopalatine nerve, which innervates the upper incisor region, enters two lateral canals separately at the nasal floor and exits the central main canal at the palate . \n damage to the bilateral nasopalatine nerves might lead to paresthesia, so we recommend careful examination for nerve fibers during endoscopic surgery, especially if fenestration is performed on both sides .\n#END SUMMARY"}

For me, it was a dream come true. \n \n But I know that the Heisman is not mine alone. Far from it. I know that my victory was made possible by the discipline and hard work of my teammates, the steady guidance of my coaches, the inspiration of the fans, and the unconditional love of my family and friends. And I know that any young man fortunate enough to win the Heisman enters into a family of sorts. Each individual carries the legacy of the award and each one is entrusted with its good name. \n \n It is for these reasons that I have made the difficult decision to forfeit my title as Heisman winner of 2005. The persistent media speculation regarding allegations dating back to my years at USC has been both painful and distracting. In no way should the storm around these allegations reflect in any way on the dignity of this award, nor on any other institutions or individuals. Nor should it distract from outstanding performances and hard-earned achievements either in the past, present or future. \n \n For the rest of my days, I will continue to strive to demonstrate through my actions and words that I was deserving of the confidence placed in me by the Heisman Trophy Trust. I would like to begin in this effort by turning a negative situation into a positive one by working with the Trustees to establish an educational program which will assist student-athletes and their families avoid some of the mistakes that I made. I am determined to view this event as an opportunity to help others and to advance the values and mission of the Heisman Trophy Trust. \n \n I will forever appreciate the honor bestowed upon me as a winner of the Heisman. While this decision is heart-breaking, I find solace in knowing that the award was made possible by the support and love of so many. Those are gifts that can never be taken away.\" ||||| FILE - In this Dec. 10, 2005, file photo, Southern California tailback back Reggie Bush pauses while giving his acceptance speech as the winner of the Heisman Trophy award in New York. Yahoo! sports is... (Associated Press) \n \n The New Orleans Saints' running back released a statement Tuesday saying he would give back the award that he won in 2005 while he was at Southern California. \n \n It's the first time college football's top award was returned by a recipient. \n \n \"While this decision is heart-breaking, I find solace in knowing that the award was made possible by the support and love of so many,\" Bush said. \"Those are gifts that can never be taken away.\" \n \n USC was hit with heavy sanctions by the NCAA this summer after it determined Bush had received improper benefits. The NCAA ruled that Bush was ineligible for the 2005 season, which opened the possibility that the Heisman Trophy Trust would take back the award. \n \n One of the few guidelines given to Heisman Trophy voters is that a player must be in compliance with NCAA rules to be eligible for the trophy. \n \n The eight-member Heisman Trophy Trust, based in New York, had said it would have to consider what to do about Bush, who won in a landslide vote over Texas quarterback Vince Young. \n \n There was no immediate word from the Heisman Trust if the award would be vacated or given to Young.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nReggie Bush says he will give back his 2005 Heisman Trophy over allegations that he received improper benefits while playing for USC. \"While this decision is heart-breaking, I find solace in knowing that the award was made possible by the support and love of so many,\" said the New Orleans Saints running back in a statement. \"Those are gifts that can never be taken away.\" The Times-Picayune has the statement here. Bush becomes the first player to return the award, and he did so before Heisman officials decided whether to strip him of the honor. \"The persistent media speculation regarding allegations dating back to my years at USC has been both painful and distracting,\" says Bush. \"In no way should the storm around these allegations reflect in any way on the dignity of this award.\" Vince Young finished second in Heisman voting that year, notes AP, but there's no word on whether he will get it belatedly.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAmerican woman and partner attending family wedding in Pakistan murdered in suspected honour killing \n \n Couple about to start new life together in the U.S. \n \n Sources suggest the groom's relatives had been happy with the marriage, but it had caused upset among the bride's family \n \n A Scottish businessman and his American wife were gunned down in the street in a suspected honour killing while on holiday in Pakistan. \n \n Glasgow-based Saif Rehman, 31, and Uzma Naurin from New York, 30, were shot dead when their car was ambushed in the north-eastern city of Gujrat following a shopping trip. \n \n \n \n The couple had been about to start a new life together in the U.S. after their trip to Pakistan for Mr Rehman’s brother’s wedding. \n \n Tragic: The couple were murdered in Pakistan during an ambush on their taxi \n \n It is understood the couple were accompanied by a driver, Mr Rehman’s sister and her two-year-old daughter, but the other passengers were unharmed. \n \n The group of four gunmen stopped the car, opened fire and killed Mr Rehman before bundling his wife into their vehicle and killing her at a spot nearby – then dumping her body by the roadside. \n \n Pakistani police are probing claims that there had been tension between the couple’s in-laws over their marriage three years ago. \n \n \n \n They were married in Manchester but another, fuller ceremony involving both sides of the family took place in Glasgow in June, when it appeared that the differences might have been resolved. \n \n The couple pictured here at a celebration. A group of four gunmen stopped the car, opened fire and killed Mr Rehman before bundling his wife into their vehicle and killing her at a spot nearby - then dumping her body by the roadside \n \n Sources close to the dispute last night suggested Mr Rehman’s relatives had been happy with the marriage, but it had caused upset among some of his bride’s relatives. \n \n Saif Ali, 30, of Cumbernauld, Dunbartonshire, who runs a mobile phone repair company, met Mr Rehman – who ran a similar firm called GSM Communications in Glasgow – three years ago. \n \n He said: ‘It was a long-distance relationship between Saif and Uzma but they made it work really well. Saif had just got a visa to go to the U.S., so they were on the brink of a new life together when this happened. \n \n Committed: The couple had been in a long-distance relationship, but had made it work \n \n ‘I found out from Saif’s brother when the killings happened on November 1 and couldn’t believe it – I was shocked, angry and devastated because we were very close. Saif had been in Glasgow for six years and met Uzma at a friend’s wedding four or five years ago.’ \n \n Describing their murder, Mr Ali added: ‘They were going back home and basically, all of a sudden, their driver just stopped the car. \n \n ‘Four people were in a different car which stopped in front of them. They pulled Saif, his sister, her daughter and his wife out of the car and, as soon as he was pulled out of the car, they shot him without saying anything.’ \n \n Mr Ali said that ‘no words were exchanged’ between Mr Rehman and any of the people who shot him. \n \n He added: ‘Five minutes up the road they basically killed her (Uzma Naurin) as well. She wasn’t found until quite a bit of time later. \n \n ‘Probably about three or four hours later, she was found, as they had basically put her in the shrubs somewhere, just on the side of the road.’ \n \n Mr Ali said Uzma Naurin worked in sales for Costa Coffee and was based in New Jersey. \n \n \n \n Her father, a taxi driver in New York, had relatives in Gujrat and the driver of the car the couple were in when they were shot is said to have been employed by his Pakistani relatives. \n \n The Foreign Office cannot become involved as Mr Rehman was a Pakistani national and his wife was a U.S. citizen. ||||| Saif and Uzma Rehman murders treated as 'honour killing' \n \n Pakistani police are investigating the deaths of Uzma Naurin and Saif Rehman \n \n Continue reading the main story Related Stories \n \n Police in Pakistan have confirmed they are treating the murder of a couple from Glasgow as an honour killing. \n \n Saif Rehman, 31, and his wife Uzma Naurin, 30, were shot after their car was ambushed in Gujrat on 1 November. \n \n It is understood Mr Rehman was shot dead by a group of men at the scene and his wife was driven away and killed. \n \n Pakistan police said Uzma's father, Musafar Hussain, went to his home in the US after the murder and they may seek to extradite him. \n \n Mr Rehman had lived in Glasgow for six years and met his wife Uzma at a friend's wedding. \n \n They were married in Glasgow in February. \n \n The Foreign Office cannot become involved in the murder as Mr Rehman was a Pakistani national and his wife was a US citizen.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPakistani police now believe that the killing of an American woman and her husband in Gujrat, Pakistan, earlier this month may have been an honor killing. New Yorker Uzma Naurin, 30, was in Pakistan for a family wedding with her husband, Scottish businessman Saif Rehman, 31, when gunmen accosted and killed them. Sources tell the Daily Mail that while Rehman’s family was happy with the marriage, Naurin’s was not. Naurin’s father, a New York taxi driver, returned to the US after the killings, and Pakistani police are now considering trying to have him extradited, the BBC reports. According to a friend, the couple was returning from a shopping trip when their driver suddenly stopped their car. Gunmen then pulled them out, shot Rehman on the spot, and made off with Naurin, killing her further down the road. The driver was reportedly employed by Naurin’s Pakistani relatives.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAfter Praying for Years to Have a Son, Mother Loses 22-Month-Old Toddler to Drowning in Church Baptistery \n \n Email Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin \n \n A mother of two daughters, who had been praying to God asking Him to also give her a son, had her prayer answered 22 months ago when she gave birth to a baby boy, who she named Brayden King. Her joy, however, turned to mourning on Friday, when the Brayden drowned in her church's baptistery. \n \n Bishop TD Strong, pastor of the Pentecostal House of Prayer in Decatur, Alabama, told al.com that little Brayden was a \"prayer baby\" because his mother, Kim King, had prayed for many years to have him. \n \n \"Twenty-two months ago He gave her a son,\" said Strong. \"And 22 months later he was taken away. I've been preaching 30 years and pastoring for 20 years, this is the first time in my ministry I've been speechless.\" \n \n According to the report, Brayden was at the church with his mother and 13-year-old sister on Friday as the women of the church prepared for a missionary prayer meeting. The boy's mother had the role of narrator in a skit for the prayer meeting so she left the boy in the care of his sister. \n \n The teen lost track of her brother and after a search he was found unresponsive in the rectangular water tank in the baptistery. According to al.com, although the tank faces the congregation, it is obscured by an altar wall. \n \n \"I'm just at a loss, because it is so close to home,\" said Strong, who noted how close he is to the family. \"People die every day. And I've done many funerals, but for a child to die in church, in the baptistery, it's beyond ordinary and something that will never be forgotten by me.\" \n \n On Sunday, Strong tried being positive to his reeling congregation, according to a follow-up al.com report. \n \n \"Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!\" he preached to his congregation while standing just a few yards from the baptistery where little Brayden died. \n \n \"I don't know that I want to go to that pool for a while,\" said Strong after the service. He explained that he planned to do baptisms at another church. \"I don't know how long it will take to heal.\" \n \n Strong said they are still trying to piece together what happened but he has not pressed the family for details. \n \n \"A lot of this stuff we deal with is not good, but the Bible says it's for good,\" Strong said in his sermon. \n \n \"You won't handle those problems with your emotions. God is not moved by emotions. God is moved by a relationship,\" he said. ||||| A toddler found submerged in a tank of baptismal water in an Alabama church died of accidental drowning, the local coroner said on Monday. \n \n Brayden King, who was two months shy of his second birthday, was under the supervision of a sister in her early teens when he fell into the tank on Friday at the Pentecostal House of Prayer in Decatur, about 75 miles north of Birmingham, said Morgan County Coroner Jeffrey Chunn. \n \n The toddler was found in 33 inches of water and declared dead after unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate him, Chunn said. \n \n The child's mother, who has two teenage daughters, had prayed for years for a son, the Huntsville Times newspaper quoted church pastor Bishop TD Strong as saying over the weekend. \n \n \"Twenty-two months ago he gave her a son,\" Strong said, according to the newspaper. \"And 22 months later he was taken away.

The March 14 walkout is led by the Women’s March’s Youth EMPOWER group. \n \n Select your state below to see where they are being held: ||||| As TV cameras swarmed around the speakers, most students huddled around makeshift memorials to those who died in the shooting last month — where a white cross for each of the 17 victims was planted on a field surrounded by candles, bouquets of flowers, soft toys and balloons.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nTen days before a massive rally against gun violence in Washington, DC, students across the country will walk out of school Wednesday to mark one month since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Students at elementary schools, high schools, and universities will walk out at 10am local time for 17 minutes to honor the 17 victims killed and to call for stricter gun laws, reports USA Today. A website for Empower, the youth branch of the Women's March, shows more than 3,100 walkouts planned (NBC News has an interactive map to help you find those near you), and not only in the US. Students in Germany, Israel, and Australia, are taking part. Non-students are also encouraged to participate by wearing orange or walking out of their jobs. Democrats in Congress will do so. They're expected to join students following a march from the White House to the Capitol, where a haunting memorial was seen Tuesday. Some students will face suspension, per the Los Angeles Times. But \"my peers and I feel there is no time more critical than this to make clear that we have had enough of gun violence,\" says a senior at University High School in Tucson, Ariz., where students plan to call lawmakers, per USA Today. \"For far too long, it has made us feel unsafe in our communities and in our classrooms.\" The walkouts are a precursor to the March For Our Lives, expected to draw 500,000 people to Washington on March 24. Thousands more will participate in sister marches. Another walkout is planned for April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nClose Get email notifications on James Beaty daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever James Beaty posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. ||||| Oklahoma 12-year-old dies from B.B. gun shot to the head \n \n By David Ferguson \n \n Wednesday, August 20, 2014 8:24 EDT \n \n A 12-year-old boy in Bache, Oklahoma was killed during a weekend sleepover when his best friend shot him in the head with a B.B. gun. \n \n Pittsburgh County Sheriff Joel Kerns told Tulsa’s Channel 6 News that the accidental killing took place on Friday night. \n \n “This young man was actually his best friend,” said Kerns. “They wasn’t arguing, they wasn’t fighting. We think it’s just horseplay.” \n \n The boy who shot the other boy told authorities that he thought the gun was unloaded. \n \n The victim’s mother rushed the boy to McAlester Regional Medical Center. Kerns explained that she felt she could transport him to the hospital faster than an ambulance could reach the house, which he described as being in a “semi-remote area.” \n \n On Saturday, the victim was transferred to a hospital in Tulsa where he died of head trauma. Kerns said that such deaths are uncommon with B.B. and pellet guns, but occasionally they occur. \n \n “It’s not unusual to lose an eye, or something of that effect with a B.B. gun, but you don’t think of death when you think of pellet or B.B. guns,” he said. \n \n “It just tears you up, and there’s another person always affected by this, it ain’t just the victim and his family, this juvenile has got to live with this the rest of his life,” the sheriff said. \n \n The incident, Kerns told Channel 6, underscores the need for anyone who handles a gun, even pellet and B.B. guns, should take a gun safety course. \n \n Watch video about this story, embedded below: \n \n NewsOn6.com – Tulsa, OK – News, Weather, Video and Sports – KOTV.com |\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA night of fun between two best friends at a sleepover turned deadly when one allegedly accidentally shot the other in the head with a pellet gun, McAlester News-Capital reports. Justin Ingle, 12, died Saturday at a Tulsa, Okla., hospital of head trauma, reports the Raw Story. The incident happened Friday night in the town of Bache. Police say the boy was hit in the temple from only a few feet away by a pellet traveling at 1,250 feet per second, according to KOTV. \"This juvenile has got to live with this the rest of his life,\" the sheriff says, referring to the boy—not being named due to his age—who allegedly fired the shot. He told authorities he didn't think the pellet gun was loaded. An investigation is ongoing, but so far, authorities believe the shooting was accidental—\"horseplay,\" as the sheriff calls it. \"You don’t think of death when you think of pellet or BB guns,\" the sheriff says, but \"this is not your Red Rider standard gun.\" In the past, it was \"not unusual to lose an eye, or something of that effect with a BB gun,\" but these days, new models are much more powerful and can kill, though such deaths are uncommon, he explains. (Earlier this year, a 7-year-old was accidentally shot and killed by a 5-year-old who was looking for his toy gun.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIt's a good thing you didn't drop $40,000 on a seat at Sarah Jessica Parker's fund-raiser for President Obama because the event was disappointingly refined. For that kind of money, the 50 guests should have been treated to scenes of co-host Anna Wintour dressing down the cleaning lady for her improper Swiffering technique, but the biggest news to come out of the party is that the president inflated the attendees' already-bursting egos a bit more. \"You're the tie-breaker,\" he said. \"You're the ultimate arbiter of which direction this country goes.\" (Also, Matthew Broderick skipped the presidential fund-raiser that took place in his own house because he's starring in the show Nice Work If You Can Get It. Presumably, we'll learn all about the ensuing spousal showdown in this week's In Touch.) \n \n Outside, it was a different story. ||||| President Barack Obama paid a visit to \"Sex and the City\" star Sarah Jessica Parker's house for a star-studded, high-dollar fundraiser on Thursday. \n \n Co-hosting with Vogue editor Anna Wintour, Parker said the guests gathered \"hopefully, with enormous enthusiasm.\" \n \n Parker also praised first lady Michelle Obama, calling her \"our radiant and extraordinary first lady” and said she had been doing “amazingly important things these last 4 years.” \n \n \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Top 5 Obama Celebrity Fundraisers) \n \n Parker's husband, actor Matthew Broderick, could not attend the fundraiser. “Matthew had a show,” Obama explained. \n \n Other notable celebrity attendees included Bravo's Andy Cohen, actress Meryl Streep and fashion designer Michael Kors. \n \n During Obama's stump speech, Parker's young son interrupted Obama with applause. \n \n “He wanted to fire up the crowd,” Obama joked. \n \n “He knows an applause line,” Cohen said, roaring. “Right on cue!” \n \n Approximately 50 guests attended the fundraiser, paying $40,000 for the evening. The only exception was Robin Hunt, a project administrator at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, who won the monthly Obama campaign win-a-dinner contest. ||||| Meryl Streep, Project Runway host Michael Kors, Vogue's Anna Wintour and Bravo's Andy Cohen were among the famous faces who attended a fundraiser for President Obama held Thursday at Sarah Jessica Parker's Manhattan home. \n \n Related Topics • Politics \n \n Parker introduced Obama at the event, giving him a hug and kiss and saying those in attendance were gathered \"hopefully, with enormous enthusiasm.\" She also called first lady Michelle Obama \"radiant and extraordinary\" and said she had been doing \"amazingly important things these last four years.\" \n \n PHOTOS: The 20 Biggest Political Players in Hollywood \n \n In his remarks, Obama said that Parker's husband, Matthew Broderick, wasn't in attendance because of his starring role in Broadway's Nice Work If You Can Get It. He noted the Obamas are \"great friends\" with Parker and Broderick. (The actress sat by Michelle Obama at the event and recently appeared in a campaign ad for the president.) \n \n Obama also joked that he is the fifth or sixth in the \"hierarchy in the White House,\" behind the first lady, their two daughters, their dog Bo and his mother-in-law. He also quipped that the fundraiser marked the couple's \"date night.\" \n \n But it wasn't all light-hearted at the event. In his remarks, Obama criticized the Republican presidential campaign ads, which he said argue that Americans are frustrated and discouraged and that \"it's the fault of the guy in the White House. It's an elegant message; it happens to be wrong. But it's crisp. You can fit it on a bumper sticker.\" \n \n VIDEO: Sarah Jessica Parker's Ad for Obama \n \n He added: “We’ve got as fundamental a choice this time out than we have had in 30, 40 or 50 years. What we are going to have to do is present very clearly to the American people that choice.\" \n \n Obama also listed his accomplishments and health care and said he remains committed to investing in science and technology efforts. \n \n “That’s why I’m running for a second term, because our work is not yet done,\" he said. \n \n Obama added that the economy is recovering because of the determination of Americans. \n \n “Because of their resilience, we’ve begun to come back,” he said. \n \n PHOTOS: Young Hollywood's Secret Breakfast With Obama \n \n After Obama noted that \"GM is now back on top,\" Parker's young son began clapping. \n \n \"He wanted to fire up the crowd,\" Obama quipped. \n \n Added Cohen: “He knows an applause line. Right on cue!” \n \n Guests at the event sat at two long tables in two long rooms, with the dividing doors open.

That means she spent $2,000 per minute to be there, TMZ helpfully calculates. Apparently it was worth it, because she described the food (\"chicken with a mustard sauce, diced tomatoes, and lots of relishes on the side of the plate\") as \"very tasty.\" In an entertaining response on Gawker, Caity Weaver wonders, \"Do you think Sarah Jessica Parker fretted and fretted over the menu before convincing herself (incorrectly) that, since Obama probably eats fancy food all the time, what he'd really enjoy is her famous 'Chicken a la Mustard with a lot of relishes on the side'?\" The fundraiser, co-hosted by Anna Wintour, was attended by all sorts of other boldface names, Politico notes, including Meryl Streep and designer Michael Kors but not including SJP's husband Matthew Broderick, who was performing in a Broadway show, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Their son was there, however, and once interrupted the president with applause, leading Obama to joke, \"He wanted to fire up the crowd.\" Another amusing story, per the New York Post: Wintour was apparently not happy with SJP's \"shabby chic\" furniture, and thus oversaw a total overhaul of her house before the fundraiser began.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nEveryone seems to be at it these days - Volkswagen, Toyota, Porsche, BMW, Nissan, the list goes on and on. \n \n Those global giants have recalled millions of vehicles over the past few years. \n \n But there are exceptions. And with so many companies asking for drivers to return their cars so faults can be fixed, it appears that Rolls-Royce was feeling a bit left out. \n \n So, the luxury car maker has joined in the latest trend by issuing its own recall - for one car. \n \n The recall notice \n \n In a letter issued by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Rolls - owned by BMW - announced it was recalling a single Ghost, made in 2014, because of an issue with the airbags. \n \n \"Rolls BMW of North America is recalling one model year 2015 Rolls-Royce Ghost manufactured on January 23, 2014,\" the letter reads. \n \n \"The affected vehicle has thorax air bags fitted to both front seats that may fail to meet the side impact performance requirements for the front seat occupants. As such, this vehicle may fail to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 214, 'Side Impact Protection'.\" \n \n A Rolls-Royce dealer \"will replace the driver-side and passenger-side thorax air bag modules, free of charge\", the letter adds - It's probably the least they can do, seeing as the car costs £231,730. \n \n According to the Financial Times, which first reported the story, the affected car had left its factory in Goodwood, East Sussex, in January 2014 but its North American owner had not yet taken delivery. \n \n The issue “was due to the incorrect labelling on one of the airbags”, a Rolls spokesman told the FT. \n \n Rolls, which sold 4,000 cars last year, officially unveiled the Ghost in 2009. The 2014 model boasts a 6.6-litre twin-turbo V12, eight-speed automatic gearbox and can reach 62mph in just 4.9 seconds. \n \n The entry-level car has an electronically-limited top speed of 155mph, which is probably why you need airbags that work... ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: \n \n - Slash pages from every domain on the web: \n \n \n \n \n \n -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) \n \n \n \n -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain \n \n - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe only single-vehicle recalls you'll usually see are for trucks, fire engines, and school buses. So the owner of a Rolls-Royce made in England can feel pretty special that his or her sedan is the subject of a rare single-car recall that affects that car alone, the Financial Times reports. The affected 2015 luxury sedan, which Syracuse.com notes typically costs at least $300,000, has front-seat air bags that may not meet side-impact requirements (which, as the Telegraph notes, isn't ideal for a car that can reach a top speed of 155mph). It's apparently the result of \"the incorrect labeling on one of the airbags,\" a rep tells the Times. No worries for the owner of the car, which was manufactured on January 23, 2014—the recall notes a Rolls-Royce dealer can hook the vehicle up with new air bags free of charge. (Maybe the owner can soup up the car with some of these insane options while it's in the shop.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nFacebook was a dominant platform in the 2008 and 2010 elections, a Pew director says. Study: Facebook users more politically engaged \n \n Facebook users are more politically engaged compared with other Internet users, a new study from Pew finds. \n \n Someone who visits Facebook multiple times per day is 2½ times more likely to attend a political rally or meeting, 57 percent more likely to influence someone else’s vote and 43 percent more likely to have said he or she would vote, the survey found. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n While the study did not conclude why Facebook users are so politically motivated, Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life Project and co-author of the report, suggests one explanation: “Facebook became a favorite platform of young people that were involved in politics in 2008 and 2010.” \n \n The survey polled 2,255 American adults during the fall of 2010 in an effort to explore how people’s use of social networking services relates to trust, tolerance, social support and community and political engagement. \n \n Pew “gets asked a lot about whether the movement of people into technology spaces makes them more partisan,” Rainie told POLITICO. “What we see here is the opposite, particularly in the case of MySpace.” \n \n According to the study, MySpace users are more likely to be open to opposing points of view. The research measured respondents’ ability to consider multiple points of view. \n \n When it comes to voting, LinkedIn users took the crown. \n \n Out of LinkedIn users surveyed, 79 percent said they voted or intended to vote, compared with 65 percent of Facebook users, 62 percent of Twitter users and 57 percent of MySpace users. \n \n Among other interesting findings, the research found that — controlling for demographic factors — Facebook users are more trusting, have more close relationships and receive more emotional support and companionship than other Internet users. \n \n “When you have trust, and are willing to engage other people, we see benefits in what kind of support you can get,” Keith Hampton, co-author of the study, told POLITICO. \n \n Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign was widely described as mastering the use of social media to organize supporters and communicate the candidate’s message, and the president’s reelection campaign believes technology will play an even more important role in 2012. \n \n “The idea is to use new technology to pursue the old-style grass-roots campaigning,” Obama campaign chief David Axelrod told POLITICO in April. \n \n To see the rest of the Pew report, go here. \n \n This article first appeared on POLITICO Pro at 5:47 a.m. on June 16, 2011. ||||| A new study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project reveals some interesting details about social networking users, debunking the myth that people who hang on Facebook a lot tend to have less real-life friends and contacts. \n \n Someone who uses Facebook several times per day, the study found, has on average \"9% more close, core ties in their overall social network compared with other internet users.\" Furthermore, Facebook users tend to get more emotional support, companionship as well as instrumental aid (meaning they're more likely to get help when sick, etc). Finally, Facebook users tend to friend other users with whom they've actually met in real life; the average Facebook user has never met only 7% of his/hers Facebook friends. \n \n Since the study was conducted during the November 2010 elections, it revealed that Facebook users also tend to be more politically active than other internet users. A Facebook user that interacts with the site multiple times per day was two and half times more likely to attend a political rally, 43% more likely to have said they would vote, and 57% more likely to persuade someone on their vote. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The study also shows that Facebook is, by far, the most engaging social platform out there, as 52% of Facebook users engage with the site daily. For comparison, 33% of Twitter users engage with the service every day, while only 7% of MySpace and 6% of LinkedIn users do the same. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The report is based on data from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from October 20 to November 28, 2010 on a sample of 2,255 adults, age 18 and older. \n \n Read the full report here.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nFacebook friends aren’t real buddies, right? Wrong, according to a new study. People who use the social network multiple times a day have an average of “9% more close, core ties in their overall social network compared with other internet users,” the Pew study says. And yes, they have actually met almost all their Facebook friends: Only 7% of their friend list consists of people they’ve never spoken to in real life, Mashable reports. Other newly emerged social networking stats: Those on Facebook get more support, companionship, and “instrumental aid”—when they’re sick, for example, friends lend a hand. Facebookers are also more politically involved than other people on the Internet: Those on the site several times daily are 2.5 times more likely to go to a meeting or rally, 57% more likely to affect another’s vote, and 43% more likely to say they’ll vote, notes Politico. Today’s average American Internet user spends almost 16% of his or her online time on social networking sites, compared to 8% in July 2007; social networking has jumped 25% over the past year.\n#END SUMMARY"}

But this time he's sipping tequila, not a Mexican beer. Jonathan Goldsmith, who played the iconic Dos Equis character from 2006 until last year, is starring in a new video for Astral Tequila that borrows creative elements from the classic beer campaign. \n \n \"I told you, I don't always drink beer,\" he says in the video, referencing the Dos Equis line. Then he simply says, \"Astral tequila.\" The scene is similar to the setting that ended many of the Dos Equis spots, in which he typically delivered his classic line -- \"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis\" -- from a cocktail table surrounded by women. In the tequila video, Latin acoustic guitar music plays in the background, just like the old beer ads, like this one: \n \n The ad marks the beginning of a new partnership with the tequila brand, which is owned by Davos Brands, whose brands include Tyku Sake and Aviation American Gin. A spokeswoman described the video being released today as a \"teaser\" that will be posted on Astral's social channels and website. It marks Goldsmith's first alcohol endorsement since Dos Equis owner Heineken USA parted ways with him last year before swapping a younger actor into the role. \n \n Advertisers own the characters they create. So in the case of Dos Equis, Heineken USA owns the Most Interesting Man. If an actor performs in character, then that would be infringing the rights of the advertiser. But actors are free to reference their old roles. So it's a fine line. \n \n \"Astral Tequila has obliged by all trademark legal requirements,\" the brand's spokeswoman stated when asked about the similarities with the Dos Equis campaign. A Heineken USA spokeswoman stated: \"We thank Jonathan Goldsmith for his long-time contributions to the brand, and wish him the best in his next endeavors.\" \n \n Ad Age showed the Astral video to Douglas Wood, senior partner at Reed Smith and general counsel to the Association of National Advertisers, for an opinion. He noted the similarities in the humor and setting to the Dos Equis spot. But he added: \"That alone, however, is not likely to be actionable. While they arguably take some of the expression and trade off on some goodwill associated with the character in the context of the Dos Equis campaign, it's hard to see any damages or a taking that goes beyond fair use. While humor alone is not a defense, it's unlikely the lighthearted references to his old character rise to an actionable cause. That said, they are on a slippery slope and should be cautious of going too far.\" \n \n In a press release touting the new Astral video, the brand stated: \"We've always wondered what pop culture icon Jonathan Goldsmith really drinks. The answer is Astral Tequila.\" \n \n But that was not always the case. In an interview with Ad Age in 2012, Goldsmith said when not drinking beer he prefers a martini or Scotch. Asked if he's had a change of heart, the Astral spokeswoman stated in an email that \"he will have to answer that for you when he is available for interviews again. Although we can say that many scotch aficionados are swapping their scotch for high-end tequilas like Astral.\" Goldsmith was not available for an interview on Tuesday. \n \n The actor, who was 77-years-old when he appeared in his last Dos Equis ad last year, has been making the most of his Dos Equis fame. He has a new memoir out called \"Stay Interesting: I Don't Always Tell Stories About My Life, But When I Do, They're True and Amazing,\" that includes accounts of his romantic flings, including one with Tina Louise, who played Ginger on \"Gilligan's Island,\" according to an account of the book in the New York Post. Politico Magazine recently published an excerpt from the book that describes how Goldsmith was invited to Barack Obama's 50th birthday party. \n \n Last year he started endorsing Wi-Fi network brand Luma in an ad in which he played himself. That campaign is expected to continue.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\n\"The Most Interesting Man in the World\" is giving up beer for tequila. Actor Jonathan Goldsmith appeared as the sophisticated, eccentric, and worldly pitchman for Dos Equis beer for nearly a decade. He's now promoting Astral Tequila, reports the AP. In a new ad (watch it here), the 78-year-old Goldsmith nods at his Dos Equis days by raising a glass of tequila and saying, \"I told you I don't always drink beer\" (a reference to his famed Dos Equis line: \"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis\"). AdAge digs in to the legality of the Dos Equis-referencing spot, with one lawyer saying Astral is on a \"slippery slope\" but not likely to find itself in court over any sort of infringement. AdAge also offers up this nugget: Tequila is not Goldsmith's professed drink of choice, or at least it wasn't in 2012 when he told the magazine he favored martinis and Scotch when not consuming beer. (Here's how Goldsmith befriended a president.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Rescuers try to reach a trapped infant inside a piece of sewage pipe, in this still image taken from video, in Jinhua city, Zhejiang province May 25, 2013. \n \n BEIJING (Reuters) - Firefighters in eastern China have rescued an abandoned newborn baby boy lodged in a sewage pipe directly beneath a toilet commode, state television reported, in a case which has sparked anger on social media sites. \n \n There are frequent reports in Chinese media of babies being abandoned, often shortly after birth, a problem attributed variously to young mothers unaware they were pregnant, the birth of an unwanted girl in a society which puts greater value on boys or China's strict family planning rules. \n \n In the latest case the infant was found in the sewage pipe in a residential building in Jinhua in the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang on Saturday afternoon after residents reported the sound of a baby crying, state television said late on Monday. \n \n Firefighters had to remove the pipe and take it to a nearby hospital, where doctors carefully cut around it to rescue the baby boy inside, the report said. \n \n The child is in a stable condition and the police are looking for his parents, state television added. \n \n The case has been widely discussed on China's Twitter-like service Sina Weibo due to the graphic nature of the footage, with calls for the parents to be severely punished. \n \n \"The parents who did this have hearts even filthier than that sewage pipe,\" wrote one user. \n \n (Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Sally Huang; Editing by Michael Perry) ||||| Chinese firefighters have rescued a newborn boy from a sewer pipe below a squat toilet, sawing out an L-shaped section and then delicately dismantling it to free the cocooned baby, who greeted the rescuers with cries. \n \n A tenant heard the baby's sounds in the public restroom of a residential building in Zhejiang province in eastern China on Saturday and notified authorities, according to the state-run news site Zhejiang News. A video of the two-hour rescue that followed was broadcast widely on Chinese news programs and websites late Monday and Tuesday. \n \n The child _ named Baby No. 59 from the number of his hospital incubator _ was reported safe in a nearby hospital, and news of the rescue prompted an outpouring from strangers who came to the hospital with diapers, baby clothes, powdered milk and offers to adopt the child. \n \n Police are treating the case as an attempted homicide, and are looking for the mother and anyone else involved in the incident. \n \n The landlord of the building in Pujiang county told Zhejiang News that it was unlikely the birth took place in the toilet room because there was no evidence of blood and she was not aware of any recent pregnancies among her tenants. \n \n The baby was stuck in the L-joint of pipe with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (3 inches). \n \n The video shows rescuers sawing out a section of the pipe along a ceiling that apparently was just below the restroom. The rescuers then rushed that section of pipe to a hospital, were firefighters and medics alternately used pliers and saws to rip apart the L-joint and free the baby. \n \n Despites the offers to adopt Baby No. 59, a doctor at the hospital said the boy would be handed over to social services if his parents do not claim him, Zhejiang News said. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?vrHW_fn2W9HQ\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA baby boy, likely just days old, is safe after Chinese rescuers pulled him from a four-inch sewage pipe. It appears the baby was flushed down the toilet; apartment building residents heard him crying, the BBC reports. When rescuers arrived on the scene, they were unable to pull the baby out, so they sawed off a portion of the pipe and brought him to the hospital. There, firefighters and doctors cut the baby out of the pipe. The case has made waves in China, with users of the Weibo microblogging service hammering the parents: \"The parents who did this have hearts even filthier than that sewage pipe,\" noted one user, per Reuters. Meanwhile, locals headed to the hospital to provide the baby with clothes, diapers, and milk, the AP reports. The baby has been dubbed Baby No. 59 after his incubator number. Police are seeking the parents in an attempted homicide case.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nFORT PIERCE, Fla. -- A federal jury has cleared a deputy of using excessive force in the 2014 shooting death of Gregory Hill Jr. and awarded $4 to Hill's family, a family lawyer said. The jury, which was weighing a lawsuit filed by Hill's family, ruled last week that St. Lucie County Deputy Christopher Newman did not violate Hill's civil rights, reports CBS affiliate WPEC-TV of West Palm Beach, Floirda. \n \n And it placed the bulk of the blame -- 99 percent -- on Hill. \n \n It found Sheriff Ken Mascara one percent liable for the killing. \n \n Help us tell his story. Help us help his kids who the jury awarded $1 to. His daughter saw everything from across the street. Police have repeatedly change the story. https://t.co/lC51NZiJFF — John M. Phillips (@JohnPhillips) May 31, 2018 \n \n WPEC-TV reports that Newman shot and killed Hill, a 30-year-old father of three children, in January 2014 after two officers responded to a complaint that Hill was playing loud music at the family's home, court documents show. The sheriff's office said Hill, a Coca-Cola warehouse employee, was carrying a gun and was drunk when deputies got to the home. \n \n Newman testified that he fired his handgun four times through the home's garage door after seeing Hill with a gun, and after the garage door closed. A single bullet fatally struck his head. An unloaded gun was later found in Hill's back pocket. \n \n The sheriff's office said in a statement that Newman was \"placed in a very difficult situation\" and \"made the best decision he could for the safety of his partner, himself, and the public given the circumstances he faced.\" \n \n \"We appreciate the jury's time and understanding and wish everyone involved in this case the best as they move forward,\" the statement said. \n \n Attorney John Phillips, who represents Hill's family, said his clients will likely appeal, WPEC-TV reported. \n \n Editor's note: This story has been corrected to indicate the Hill family was awarded $4. ||||| For more than four years, questions swirled about the shooting death of Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr. at his home in Fort Pierce, Fla. After all, there were only three witnesses to how the entire episode unfolded: two St. Lucie County sheriff’s deputies and Mr. Hill. \n \n Mr. Hill, a 30-year-old African-American, was fatally shot by a white sheriff’s deputy who had responded to a noise complaint about music Mr. Hill had been playing in his garage. Toxicology reports showed Mr. Hill was drunk at the time. And after a brief encounter with the deputies, he was discovered dead inside the garage with a gun in his back pocket; the deputies said he had been holding it during their confrontation, though that claim is in dispute. Mr. Hill had been shot three times by one of the deputies, Christopher Newman. \n \n Among other things, a federal jury hearing a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Mr. Hill’s family was asked to decide whether his constitutional rights had been violated and whether his estate should be awarded damages. How much, jurors were asked, were the pain and suffering of Mr. Hill’s three children worth? \n \n Last week, the jurors delivered their verdict. Deputy Newman had not used excessive force, they concluded, but the St. Lucie County sheriff, Ken Mascara, had been ever so slightly negligent given Deputy Newman’s actions. The jury awarded $4 in damages: $1 for funeral expenses and $1 for each child’s loss.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe family of a Florida man who was shot and killed in his garage by a police deputy has been awarded just $4 in damages, reports CBS. Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages ($1 for funeral expenses and $1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from $4. The family's lawyer says, due to Hill's intoxication, the judge will further reduce the award from 4 cents to nothing. “I don’t get it,” the family's lawyer tells the Times. \"I think [the jurors] were trying to insult the case. Why go there with the $1? That was the hurtful part.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

One of several service providers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, it designed the failed cement seal that experts believe allowed explosive gas to ... ||||| Halliburton's net income more than doubled during the first three months of the year the company said Monday, as drilling activity in North America picked up. \n \n The price for a barrel of oil has jumped 17 percent this year, boosting demand sharply for companies like Halliburton, which provide a variety of services for oil and natural gas drillers. \n \n The Houston company reported first-quarter earnings of $511 million, or 56 cents per share, compared with $206 million, or 23 cents per share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose 40 percent to $5.28 billion. \n \n After adjusting for a $46 million charge related to international sanctions on oil operations in Libya, Halliburton said it earned 61 cents per share. \n \n Analysts had expected earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $4.87 billion, according to FactSet. \n \n Halliburton Co. posted a big revenue gains despite a slowdown in offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and political turmoil in North Africa that halted oil production in Libya. The company said an \"unabated shift\" by the industry to developing oil on land, particularly in underground shale deposits in the U.S., more than offset that decline in activity. \n \n Revenue in North America surged 75 percent in the quarter while revenue from international operations increased 11 percent, according to the company. Completion and production revenue jumped 62 percent to $3.2 billion due to increased drilling activity in the U.S. Drilling and evaluation revenue increased 17 percent to $2.1 billion as activity picked up in the western hemisphere and Iraq. \n \n The rebellion in Libya will continue to hinder oil operations in the country, but overall, Halliburton President and CEO Dave Lesar said those projects will eventually return to normal. \n \n \"We remain very optimistic about this market and expect to be profitable in 2011,\" Lesar said. \n \n Shares increased 31 cents to $47.13 in premarket trading.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nDespite challenges arising from political unrest in the Arab world, Halliburton's net income has more than doubled during the first quarter of 2011. The oil-field services company credits the soaring earnings to an increase in unconventional North American oil and natural-gas drilling; the AP reports that North American revenue jumped 75%, while revenue from international operations was up 11%. The Wall Street Journal notes that high oil prices also helped. Halliburton's first-quarter profit was $511 million, up from $206 million a year prior.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\na first estimate of the total number of variable stars observable by gaia was done by eyer ( 1999 ) .\nthe star population used came from the star -

The Secret Service told CNN, “For operational security purposes the Secret Service does not comment on its protective operations.” Sanders didn’t provide comment to news organizations. \n \n The Secret Service typically protects the president, vice president, their immediate families, former presidents (along with spouses and children under 16), foreign heads of states, and major presidential and vice-presidential candidates and spouses. Press secretaries are not generally on the list. \n \n The Trump Administration has been criticized over Secret Service costs due to the large size of Trump’s immediate family and his frequent travel to his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, to play golf and meet with guests. \n \n Over the weekend, the owner of Red Hen, a restaurant in Lexington, Va., asked Sanders to leave because of differences with her politics. President Donald Trump later castigated the restaurant on Twitter, saying that the restaurant’s exterior was dirty. The restaurant has also received thousands of negative Yelp reviews. Unaffiliated restaurants with the same name have received calls threatening murder. ||||| White House press secretary Sarah Sanders will receive U.S. Secret Service protection at her home on a temporary basis, sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News. \n \n The anticipated protection comes after Sanders, one of the most visible members of Mr. Trump's White House, was refused service at the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, Friday night. Sanders said she was told to leave the restaurant in a tweet Saturday, and the incident snowballed to dominate social media and much of the news cycle. \n \n The Secret Service is not commenting on the matter of Sanders' home protection, which was first reported by NBC News. \n \n Sources said it is possible other White House staff members will receive similar protection. President Trump can personally sign off on additional protections for members of the White House staff. \n \n Last week, protesters confronted Homeland Secretary Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen outside a Mexican restaurant in Washington. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, were confronted by a small group of protesters Tuesday evening. \n \n The Sanders incident in particular has renewed debates about political civility. \n \n Jeff Pegues contributed reporting. \n \n \n \n ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

A source tells NBC News that the service will protect the home of Sarah Sanders on a temporary basis starting Wednesday. President Trump has the power to sign off on Secret Service protection for any staff member, and sources tell CBS News that it is possible that he will grant extra protection to other high-profile employees soon. The move comes as controversy rages after the Red Hen restaurant in Virginia refused to serve Sanders last Friday. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters later called for the public to confront members of the Trump administration whenever they could. The Secret Service won't say whether it is protecting Sanders. \"For operational security purposes the Secret Service does not comment on its protective operations,\" a spokesperson tells CNN. The Secret Service usually protects current and former presidents and their families, along with foreign heads of state and major presidential candidates, reports Fortune, which calls it an \"unusual level of protection\" for a press secretary. Congressional leaders and Cabinet members also sometimes receive Secret Service protection. (Elaine Chao and husband Mitch McConnell were confronted by protesters Monday night.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

The car had no obvious signs of damage, and the couple’s three children, all between 8 months and 4 years old, were unharmed inside, Gary Davidson a spokesman for the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office told CBS News. \n \n “There was no obvious signs of trauma that would immediately explain the cause of death or what happened,” Davidson said. \n \n Investigators have not determined why the couple exited the vehicle, which was found with its hazard lights blinking, but Davidson said no signs of foul play have been detected. \n \n He said an autopsy on the deceased couple has yet to be completed. ||||| Updated: Jan 3, 2017 - 6:41 PM \n \n DELAND, Fla. - Volusia County authorities are trying to figure out the circumstances surrounding the deaths of a husband and wife who were found outside their SUV on I-4 in DeLand while their three children were unharmed inside the vehicle. \n \n Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said authorities are relying on autopsy results. \n \n Heather Kelsey, 30, and her husband, Daniel Kelsey, 32, of Ormond Beach were found dead Saturday when a Florida Highway Patrol trooper spotted hazard lights on the couple’s SUV, authorities said. Daniel and Heather Kelsey \n \n “Right now, it's in the hands of the medical examiner. We have everything we have, but to determine the cause of death is what we are waiting for, and we are expecting to get that in the next day or two,\" Chitwood said. \n \n The couple’s three children, ranging in age from 8 months to 4 years old, were found in the SUV. \n \n Investigators said there were no obvious signs of foul play. \n \n Chitwood said the couple had a history of drug use, but Channel 9 did not find any arrest information in Volusia County. \n \n “At first glance, the investigators feel it was an overdose based on what they see,” Chitwood said. \n \n Family and friends described them as a loving and happy couple. \n \n \"It boggles me.

He found a couple dead on the side of the road nearby and their three children still strapped into their car seats, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Authorities say the couple had a history of drug abuse, and it appears 32-year-old Daniel Kelsey may have died from an overdose. Questions remain about the cause of death for 30-year-old Heather Kelsey, and authorities are waiting on the results of an autopsy. The couple's three children—ages 2, 1, and an infant—were unharmed. Authorities don't believe the car had been on the side of road for longer than 30 minutes. The children are staying with relatives. There were no signs of foul play or trauma, though it remains unclear why Daniel and Heather Kelsey got out of the car before dying, CBS News reports. They had been married for nearly six years. \"It boggles me,\" a family friend tells WFTV. \"I'm blown away by it. I don't want to believe it.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThese crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Without the swarm, the average chance for such an earthquake striking on any given week is 1 in 6,000.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe possibility of the Big One hitting along the \"locked, loaded, and ready to go\" San Andreas fault is an ever-present risk in southern California—and lately, it has been more present than usual. A cluster of more than 200 earthquakes hit a seismic zone under the Salton Sea at the southern end of the fault on Monday, the Los Angeles Times reports. The jolts, the strongest of which was magnitude 4.3, lasted for more than 24 hours and US Geological Survey experts say the activity has temporarily raised the risk of an earthquake 7.4 magnitude or stronger to as high as 1 in 100. The area has triggered other quakes in the past and experts say the increased risk will last until next Tuesday. The California Office of Emergency Services has issued an earthquake advisory for the region, CBS Los Angeles reports. \"California is earthquake country. We must always be prepared and not let our guard down,\" says OES Director Mark Ghilarducci, who describes the warning as an opportunity to revisit emergency plans. The Smithsonian reports that the increased risk came the same week that Gov. Jerry Brown approved an expansion of California's early warning system. The system will be able to provide up to a minute's warning ahead of major quakes, long enough for train drivers to slow down or for workers to move away from dangerous machinery.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Kelly was blindsided by Tuesday's announcement. She found out at 10:30 in the morning ... the same time Disney made the announcement. She never got a call from Disney CEO Bob Iger or anyone else at the Mouse House. \n \n Our ABC sources say Kelly -- and virtually everyone on her show -- feels Disney has screamed to the world they don't care about 'Live' ... their singular focus is breathing life into 'GMA,' which has lost a big chunk of its audience over the last year. \n \n We're told there's serious talk about giving 'Live' the boot at 9 AM and adding a third hour to 'GMA.' It's unclear if Disney is eyeing a time slot later in the morning for Kelly's show. It's pretty incredible, since 'Live' has been super successful on Kelly's watch. \n \n Adding a 3rd hour to 'GMA' is the logical next move, since Strahan has established himself in the 9 AM time slot. \n \n As for Kelly, it's unclear if Disney can ever win her back. It's not difficult to understand how pissed she is ... it's like the Ann Curry/NBC mess, but more outrageous. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

With Kelly and Michael Wednesday morning, and sources tell TMZ it's because she's outraged over the way Michael Strahan is handling his exit from the show. Ripa reportedly heard the news in a meeting with Strahan, a producer, and a network manager after Tuesday's show, but the meeting didn't take place until the same time Disney made the public announcement. Sources say Disney CEO Bob Iger told Strahan to keep the news secret from everyone, but Ripa believes she deserved to be told earlier than she was because she played such a big role in Strahan's rise to TV success. The rest of the Live! staff is also said to be none too happy they were kept in the dark. Sources also say there's no love lost between Ripa and Strahan; Ripa reportedly thinks Strahan is conceited and doesn't respect her. Strahan reportedly reached out to Ripa after the announcement of his exit—and he lauded her at the end of Wednesday's show—but she has yet to respond. No one from Disney is said to have reached out to her, and sources say she feels Disney has made it obvious they only care about boosting Good Morning America (which Strahan is leaving to host) and not Live. Sources expect Ripa to miss more upcoming shows. (Here are the two rumored frontrunners for Strahan's Live! spot.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it.

If any of the content was stolen from them, well, I have no idea what to tell you. Laugh at the menu or don't. There are more important things to stress over in life than Twitter. \n \n Back on his Twitter feed, Mytko concluded a night of responding to aggrieved joke authors and their supporters by saying, \"and I hope all you haters picked up a few followers to help fill that empty void in your soul.\" \n \n Vassiliadis has been reached for comment, but has yet to respond. This post will be updated if and when she does. \n \n [image via @a_girl_irl]\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nGuy Fieri decided to go with the simple \"guysamerican.com\" for his restaurant, Guy's American Kitchen and Bar. But he really should have also registered the longer version, too, Fast Company reports. Instead, Bryan Mytko snapped up GuysAmericanKitchenAndBar.com and posted a hilarious fake menu there that's gone viral. Sample items: Honky-Tonky Double Barrel Meat Loaded Blast: \"A Sammy Hagar lookalike pushes your face into a leather bag filled with oil.\" Reno!!!: \"Popcorn crusted popcorn chicken stuffed inside Guy's Nuthin' Fancy Meatloaf.\" (To this one, you can \"Add a Cinnabon and two more Cinnabons\" for just $4.95.) Superbowl Bash Bro'det: This one involves a lot of Velveeta and is served in a bidet that's actually \"an MP3 player that plays Smash Mouth while you eat.\" Sadly, the menu is tinged with scandal: Someone claiming to be a friend of Mytko's tells Gawker Mytko didn't credit Pauline Vassiliadis with the menu's design. And, making matters worse, a few people also pointed out on Twitter that Mytko seems to have stolen many of the jokes from other Twitter users (comparisons here and here). (Mytko, for his part, says he \"had no idea the stuff was theirs.\") Despite the controversy, we say the menu is still worth reading: It's almost as funny as last year's scathing New York Times review of the restaurant.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTruth rating: 0 \n \n By Daniel Gates \n \n “Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have spent just over £500,000 on four gold-plated toilets,” claims The Sun. \n \n That’s roughly $765,000. \n \n Um… what?! \n \n The Sun says that the couple’s new mansion in Bel Air will be outfitted with insanely expensive furnishings including “six special-edition beds” costing $175,000 apiece and a “Swarovski-encrusted fridge freezer.” \n \n If those expenditures seem outrageous even given the couple’s wealth, that’s because The Sun pulled the numbers from… well, let’s just say a place intimately familiar with toilets. \n \n The story is “not true,” a source assures Gossip Cop. \n \n Given The Sun’s recent bogus report about a West-Kardashian engagement, and previous missteps with the couple, we’re not surprised. \n \n Consider this story flushed. \n \n Follow @GossipCop on Twitter! \n \n Like us on Facebook!\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe Kimye camp is denying this, but it seems totally within the realm of possibility: The Sun reports that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West recently shelled out more than $764,000 for four toilets (which are, obviously, gold-plated) for their new Bel Air mansion. A source explains, \"They expect the interior to cost twice as much as the property. They’re spending more than a million on a security system alone.\" The source adds that they've also spent the same amount on kitchen gear (including a Swarovski crystal-studded freezer) as they did on the toilets, plus more than $174,00 each on six swanky special-edition beds.

One man gets scared and shoots his buddy in the back, all while in search of a Sasquatch. \n \n But the Roger County Sheriff’s Office isn’t buying it. \n \n \"Any story that starts out that someone is on a hunt for Sasquatch, we probably have problems with you from the get go,\" said Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton. \n \n A 911 call came in late Saturday night from the QuikTrip near Interstate 44 and 161st Street. \n \n Deputies arrived and transported the wounded man to the hospital where he underwent surgery. Authorities said he remains in stable condition. \n \n Deputies questioned everyone involved a second time and it became clear there was no Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Yeti involved in the shooting. \n \n “It was their remarks for going out in the woods or whatever at night and looking for varmints,\" Walton said. \n \n As more of the truth comes out, the Rogers County sheriff says it became clear that one of the men had his wife with him -- the man became startled and shot the second man, while a fourth individual helped dispose of the gun in a nearby lake. \n \n \"A situation where probably no one would have went to jail if they would have just told the truth at first, but as it unfolds we had three booked in to custody and one in the hospital,\" Walton said. \n \n Officials tell 2NEWS Omar Pineda is being held for reckless conduct with a firearm and obstructing an officer. \n \n His wife, Lacey Pineda, is accused of obstructing an officer and Perry James was arrested for destroying evidence. \n \n A Tulsa County sheriff's dive team recovered the handgun they believe was used -- a 9 millimeter handgun -- as the sheriff's investigation wrapped up. \n \n Two of the three charged in the shooting have bailed out of Rogers County Jail. The alleged gunman, Omar Pineda, remains in jail. ||||| File photo.Rogers County deputies arrested three people after another man was shot in the back Saturday during a reported \"Sasquatch hunt.\" \n \n Walton said the dishonesty of the \"hunters\" wasted several hours of time for two agencies. \n \n Rogers County Sheriff's Department arrested three people in what appears to be an accidental shooting. One of the men told deputies he'd shot his friend while the two were on a Sasquatch hunting expedition. \n \n \"If [they] had just been factual, upfront and truthful with us and explained that this was truly an accident, as strange as it might sound, we would have went ahead and investigated and probably nobody would have [gone] to jail,\" Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton said. \n \n The two men were hunting - apparently for Bigfoot - around 177th East Avenue and Tiger Switch Road Saturday night. Omar Pineda reportedly heard a \"barking noise,\" jerked and shot his friend in the back, authorities say. \n \n \"When you start off with an explanation like that, do you believe anything after that?\" Walton said Sunday morning. \n \n The men met emergency responders at a QuikTrip near Interstate 44 and 161st Street. The wounded man is expected to survive. \n \n Pineda, 21, was arrested for reckless conduct with a firearm and obstruction. \n \n Deputies also arrested Perry Don James, Pineda's father-in-law. James threw his son-in-law's gun in a pond on the property because he is a convicted felon and was afraid to have the gun on his property, Walton said. \n \n James, 53, was booked on complaints of felon in possession of a firearm and destruction of evidence. \n \n \n \n The shooting victim was also carrying a gun, though he dropped it when he got shot, according to a news release. Dive teams spent much of the day looking for a gun tossed in the pond. \n \n \"The aggravating part of this whole deal is that their dishonesty wasted several man hours of not only the Rogers County Sheriff's Office, but our partners at the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office,\" Walton said. \n \n Deputies arrested 22-year-old Lacey Jane Pineda, Omar's wife, for obstruction because she told police at one point that someone else had shot at her husband and his friend, according to RCSO. \n \n \"To our knowledge, no Bigfoot sightings in Rogers County,\" Walton said. \"I think our focus is career criminals and thugs, and we're going to stay focused on that and let somebody else go after Bigfoot.\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIf Bigfoot is lurking in the woods of Rogers County, Oklahoma, this sounds like the wrong group to send to hunt the creature down: Three people were arrested and one was hospitalized after a hunting trip, supposedly to find Sasquatch, went incredibly wrong, News9 reports. After Omar Pinera, 21, was startled by a noise and shot his friend in the back, he was arrested, as was his wife and father-in-law, after they all told deputies conflicting stories about the incident. Pinera was charged with obstruction and reckless conduct with a firearm, his wife was charged with obstruction for claiming somebody else had fired a shot, and his father-in-law was busted for destruction of evidence after throwing Pinera's handgun in a lake, according to WPTV. The shot man is expected to survive, and Bigfoot remains elusive. \"To our knowledge, no Bigfoot sightings in Rogers County,\" the county sheriff says. \"I think our focus is career criminals and thugs, and we're going to stay focused on that and let somebody else go after Bigfoot.\" (Last year, a Montana man dressed up as Bigfoot, and ended up getting killed.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

And sometimes, that plan to shove $1,200 worth of meat down your pants and walk out of a supermarket undetected doesn't end so well. Police in Cortlandt, NY, have charged Gregory Rodriguez with grand larceny after accusing him of doing just that at the A&P where he works, reports the local Daily Voice. Rodriguez was actually arrested a day after the theft, and two burning questions sadly remain unanswered, according to the AP and the Journal News: How many trips did it take, and where's the meat now?

A Chicago woman was killed in a fiery crash Saturday morning after her husband drove off a barricaded bridge in northwest Indiana. \n \n The crash happened about 9:30 a.m. at Cline Avenue and Riley Road, according to a statement from the Lake County sheriff’s office. \n \n Police said the driver, 64-year-old Iftikhar Hussain, drove a 2014 Nissan Sentra around barricades and left Cline Avenue. He then drove the vehicle off the bridge, causing it to fall 38-feet, police said. Hussain then exited the vehicle and ran, leaving his wife behind in the passenger seat, just moments before the car became engulfed in flames, police said. \n \n The bridge where Iftikhar drove off is marked with numerous barricades, including orange barrels, concrete barricades, cones and a large wooden sign that reads, “ROAD CLOSED.” \n \n The woman was identified as 51-year-old Zohra Hussain, police said. Hussain, of the 6100 block of North Kedvale, suffered burns and was pronounced dead at the scene, the Lake County coroner’s office said. \n \n The driver was taken to Methodist Hospital in Gary, where his condition stabilized, police said. \n \n The crash is under investigation and no citations were issued as of Saturday evening. \n \n Further details were not available. ||||| Business reporter \n \n Joseph S.

Stanley McChrystal ultimately led to the resignation of the U.S. commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan. \n \n Coroner's Lt. Fred Corral says Thursday that the findings on the cause of death are deferred pending the results of toxicology tests expected in eight to 10 weeks. \n \n Corral says an autopsy was performed Wednesday and the 33-year-old Hastings was identified by matching fingerprints to prints the FBI had on file. \n \n The car crashed early Tuesday in Los Angeles and burned furiously. \n \n Hastings' death was announced earlier by his employer without details. ||||| WASHINGTON – During the weeks before he was killed in a car crash in Los Angeles, reporter Michael Hastings was researching a story about a privacy lawsuit brought by Florida socialite Jill Kelley against the Department of Defense and the FBI. \n \n Hastings, 33, was scheduled to meet with a representative of Kelley next week in Los Angeles to discuss the case, according to a person close to Kelley. Hastings wrote for Rolling Stone and the website BuzzFeed. \n \n Kelley alleges that military officials and the FBI leaked her name to the media to discredit her after she reported receiving a stream of emails that were traced to Paula Broadwell, a biographer of former CIA director David H. Petraeus, according to a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., on June 3. \n \n Petraeus resigned from the CIA after publicly admitting that he and Broadwell had carried on an extramarital affair. \n \n PHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments \n \n The story about Kelley, Broadwell and the Petraeus affair would have been consistent with topics that Hastings has focused on during his reporting career. His unvarnished 2010 Rolling Stone profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan, led to McChrystal’s resignation. The story described the disdain McChrystal’s staff showed for President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. \n \n Since Hasting’s death early Tuesday, wild conspiracy theories have bloomed on the Internet implying that he was murdered by powerful forces wanting to silence him. \n \n On Wednesday night, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks inserted itself into the story, publishing a message on Twitter that Hasting had contacted a lawyer for the organization hours before his car smashed into a tree on North Highland Avenue in Los Angeles. \n \n The message read: “Michael Hastings contacted WikiLeaks lawyer Jennifer Robinson just a few hours before he died, saying that the FBI was investigating him.” \n \n The crash is under investigation and there will be an official accident report after a toxicology test is completed in the coming weeks. \n \n Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook \n \n brian.bennett@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @bybrianbennett\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWell this should provide some grist for the conspiracy theory mill: Michael Hastings was working on a piece about a privacy lawsuit from Jill Kelley before his fatal car crash. (You might remember Kelley from her role in David Petraeus' scandalous love quadrangle.) Hastings was scheduled to meet with one of the socialite's reps next week, the LA Times reports. Of course, given Hastings' usual beat, virtually any story he might have been working on could prompt conspiracy theorists, and some have already been at work. WikiLeaks helped matters along last night by revealing that Hastings had contacted a WikiLeaks lawyer \"just a few hours before he died, saying that the FBI was investigating him.\" The Los Angeles County coroner, meanwhile, confirmed today that it was indeed Hastings who was killed, reports AP.\n#END SUMMARY"}

On Wednesday, a YouTube spokesperson said the video \"is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube.\" \n \n The spokesperson added, however, that the site restricted access in Libya and Egypt because of the unrest. \"We work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions. This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere,\" the spokesperson said. \n \n The video, a trailer for what the promoters say is full-length film produced in the United States, has been cited as a cause for the some of the violent unrest in several Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt and Yemen.

Security officers in Khartoum fired tear gas at about 5,000 angry demonstrators, who were also protesting at nearby British and German embassies. In other developments: Two demonstrators were killed and at least 29 injured outside the US embassy in Tunisia, where angry crowds gathered after setting fire to the American School. At least one person died and 25 others were hurt in the Lebanese city of Tripoli, where protesters torched and ransacked a KFC and a Hardee's restaurant, NBC News reports. Demonstrations there were timed to concur with a 3-day visit by Pope Benedict XVI, according to Lebanese officials. A protester died of birdshot wounds during a battle with police near Cairo's US embassy. He was the first Egyptian fatality during the riots. A large demonstration is underway outside the BMCI bank in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, Huffington Post reports. The White House has asked YouTube to review—but not remove—the anti-Muslim video that apparently sparked the rioting, the Washington Post reports. Administration officials asked \"them to review whether it violates their terms of use,\" said a National Security Council spokesman. (YouTube has already removed the video in protesting countries.)

old man, who had a medical history of panic disorder, visited another hospital due to dyspnea on mild exertion . \n a coronary angiography showed a single coronary artery originating from the right coronary ostium . a single coronary artery bifurcated into the right coronary artery and left main coronary artery . \n the left main coronary artery coursed between the main pulmonary artery and aorta before bifurcating into the left descending artery and circumflex artery . \n we thought that panic symptoms or dyspnea on exertion might be a sign of myocardial ischemia due to compression of the left main coronary artery by the pulmonary artery and aorta . \n we decided that surgical treatment was the best option due to the high risk of sudden death associated with a coronary anomaly . under general anesthesia \n we dissected the left main coronary artery between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery on the beating heart . \n the proximal left main coronary artery was bifurcated from a single coronary artery that originated from the right coronary sinus . under cardiopulmonary bypass, \n only one coronary ostium was observed in the right coronary sinus, and a single coronary artery originated from the ostium . \n a 5-mm arteriotomy was made to the left main coronary artery at the site in which the left coronary ostium should have been located . \n neo - ostium formation was performed with a 5-mm puncher in the left coronary sinus . \n anastomosis between the neo - ostium and the left main coronary arteriotomy site was performed using a 7 - 0 prolene continuous running suture ( fig . \n the aortic cross clamping time was 88 minutes, and total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 117 minutes . \n follow - up computed tomographic angiography before discharge showed good patency of the neo - ostium in the left coronary sinus without stenosis at the anastomosis site ( fig . \n the patient remained asymptomatic without any complications or events for 15 months after the surgery . \n angelini reviewed 1,950 coronary angiographies and reported that the incidence of right coronary artery originating from the left coronary sinus was 0.92% and vice versa was 0.15%, with a total incidence of 1.07% . \n patients are usually asymptomatic . however, it may cause angina, syncope, and even life - threatening complications such as myocardial infarction or ventricular fibrillation . \n thus, we must consider surgical treatment or intervention if signs of myocardial ischemia are present . \n several surgical techniques can be utilized to treat coronary anomalies, such as coronary reimplantation to the original sinus, coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ), pulmonary artery translocation, unroofing, and neo - ostium formation . in this case, the left main coronary artery was bifurcated from a single coronary artery originating in the right coronary sinus . \n furthermore, the left main coronary artery passed between the pulmonary artery and aorta to reach the left heart . \n cabg, coronary reimplantation, unroofing or neo - ostium formation could therefore have been considered as viable surgical options . \n coronary reimplantation is one of the most physiologically beneficial repairs, but is technically difficult, and stenosis may occur at the site of anastomosis . \n cabg is technically feasible, but the arterial conduit has a competitive flow problem if no stenotic lesions are present on the natural coronary artery . \n also, a vein conduit may be problematic if the patient is young because of long - term patency . \n however, extended unroofing may cause valve insufficiency if the anomalous coronary artery is located under the valve commissure . \n unroofing was not proper for our case because a separated left main coronary artery originated from a single coronary artery, not the right coronary sinus . \n neo - ostium formation in the left coronary sinus without unroofing was considered to be a proper surgical treatment in this case . \n successful surgical treatment of anomalous of coronary anomaly depends on expertise in anatomic and hemodynamic pathophysiology, in addition to the selection of the appropriate surgical treatment option . \n we report that this case was successfully treated with neo - ostium formation in anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right coronary system .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAnomalous origin of a coronary aortic artery is a rare cardiac anomaly . although it can cause angina, syncope, and palpitations, most patients are asymptomatic . \n this anomaly requires surgical treatment or intervention because it is associated with sudden death . \n several surgical techniques, such as coronary reimplantation, coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ), unroofing, and neo -

They also suspected she gave patients laxatives to embarrass the colleagues who worked after her. \n \n \"We wondered whether these deaths could be so frequent without anyone doing anything,\" a coworker told Corriere della Sera. \n \n The investigation and arrest resulted from the death of a 78-year-old patient who was found to have died from a potassium chloride injection, the New York Post reported. But homicide may be more difficult to prove in the case of the earlier victims. \n \n Prosecutors told Corriere that potassium leaves no trace after a few days, making it challenging to investigate. \n \n Police searched Poggiali's phone and found a photo of the nurse giving a thumbs up next to the body of a patient moments after that patient's death, Corriere reported. \n \n [H/T NY Post, Photo: Twitter] ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Daniela Poggiali, 42, was arrested Friday in connection with 11 patient deaths and had already been under suspicion of killing another in April, the New York Post and ANSA report. Police then found a selfie on her phone of Poggiali giving a thumbs-up beside a dead patient in northeast Italy. \"I can assure you in that all my professional years of seeing shocking photos, there were few such as these,\" says a prosecutor. Poggiali was originally suspected of killing a 78-year-old woman who had entered the hospital with minor health issues and allegedly died from a potassium overdose—which can trigger cardiac arrest and be hard to trace because it leaves the body soon after death. Now police believe she may have killed up to 38 patients who \"needed extra care or had pushy relatives,\" reports ANSA. Co-workers, who had already noticed patient deaths during Poggiali's shifts, describe her as \"a cold, polished\" person who worked hard, Gawker reports. They also say she had been accused of giving patients heavy laxatives to make life harder for the next nurse on duty.

Even after SEC lawyers had told Goldman in writing they were prepared to file a federal suit, the firm gave no ground, declining to ask for a settlement, according to three people familiar with the case. The agency could prolong negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal Goldman would accept, as the SEC had often done in previous cases, or take the bank to court. \n \n Endorsing the recommendation of investigators, the SEC's five-member commission voted 3 to 2 to proceed with the civil suit, taking a high-stakes gamble that pits Wall Street's top regulator against its most storied bank. The case, filed Friday, \n \n has provoked a counteroffensive from Goldman, which says it was blindsided by the suit. Goldman's defenders are suggesting that the suit may have been designed to help make the case for the Obama administration's push this month for legislation to overhaul financial regulation. \n \n SEC officials say that they told Goldman last summer the agency would probably bring action, and that the bank did not show any contrition. At the same time, they say they wanted to use the Goldman case to make a broader statement about the agency's renewed intention of holding prominent financial firms accountable for misconduct. \n \n Neither SEC officials nor Goldman executives would discuss the internal dynamics of the case on the record. But people in both camps were preparing Monday for an epic court battle that could offer a chance for both sides to restore their reputations after they were sullied during the financial crisis. \n \n Victory for the SEC, Wall Street's top regulator, would help restore credibility after it was sharply criticized for not aggressively enforcing securities laws. Victory for Goldman could help the firm answer critics who allege it epitomized the excesses that led the financial sector into its worst crisis in decades. \n \n On Monday, the case reverberated around the world. Financial regulators in London and Germany said they would open investigations to see if Goldman's sale of mortgage securities broke local laws. \n \n Goldman's domestic legal troubles could be compounded abroad as foreign regulators open probes into the investment. London's Financial Services Authority and Germany's BaFin regulatory agency said Monday that they were coordinating with the SEC. The Royal Bank of Scotland lost an estimated $850 million and the Duesseldorf-based IKB Deutsche-Industriebank lost more than $100 million on mortgage-related securities set up by Goldman. [Story, A7.] \n \n The SEC's suit centers on a development central to the financial crisis: the creation of exotic investments that allowed firms to bet on the direction of the housing market. \n \n The suit asserts that Goldman defrauded investors when it sold them a subprime-mortgage investment in 2007 that was secretly designed to lose value. The agency alleges that Goldman created and marketed the investment without telling its clients that Paulson & Co., a prominent hedge fund, had helped the bank assemble the investment while at the same time was placing bets that it would lose value. The bank received $15 million from Paulson & Co. for its services. \n \n Goldman has denied the allegations, releasing three statements since Friday rebutting the SEC's points. ||||| The Securities and Exchange Commission decided to sue Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over the objections of two Republican commissioners, suggesting an unusual split at the agency that could politicize one of its most prominent cases in years. \n \n People familiar with the matter said the five-member commission held a lengthy meeting Wednesday to debate the civil-fraud charges against Goldman, and ultimately voted 3-2 in favor of pushing forward. The charges were filed Friday. \n \n Normally the agency prefers to have unanimous support when bringing enforcement actions against the firms it regulates. Word of the SEC split could exacerbate partisan tensions in Washington ...\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe decision to go after Goldman split the SEC along party lines and came only after months of secret talks broke down. Though the commission generally aims for unanimity, they voted, 3-2, to proceed with the civil suit despite opposition from two Republican members. The tiebreaker was an Independent commissioner appointed by President Obama. Word of the rift threatens to politicize the case and widen the gulf between Dems and Republicans over the financial overhaul the White House is pushing, the Wall Street Journal notes. Though Goldman insists the suit came as a surprise, the Washington Post claims the case came after months of secret talks with Goldman's lawyers. The SEC says they informed the bank they'd bring legal action last summer. The talks reached an impasse last month when Goldman refused to give ground or show contrition, the commission says.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTim Tebowed and Denver rose as one. \n \n The Broncos quarterback's 80-yard touchdown pass to receiver Demaryius Thomas on the first play of overtime against Pittsburgh both clinched Sunday's game and wrote another improbable chapter in Tebow's book of clutch plays to win high-pressure games. \n \n His performance also borrowed a little magic from another famous book. \n \n The devout Christian's stat line in Sunday's game mirrors the numbering of the Biblical passage that Tebow at times had painted on to his black eye paint during his career at the University of Florida -- John 3:16. \n \n The passage reads, according to the New American Standard Bible, \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" \n \n Officially, Tebow passed for 316 yards against the Steelers, completing 10 of 21 pass attempts -- meaning he passed for 31.6 yards per completion. \n \n After his final pass was caught and brilliantly taken downfield by Thomas, Tebow shrugged off three bad weeks -- when he threw for just one touchdown and four interceptions -- and took a knee and prayed in his classic style. \n \n \"First and foremost, I just want to thank my savior, the Lord, Jesus Christ,\" Tebow said at the postgame press conference. \"I am so thankful for the platform God has given me.\" \n \n Next up for those on the Tebow bandwagon, a trip to New England to tackle Tom Brady and the Patriots in the AFC divisional playoff game on Saturday. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. \n \n You are using unsupported browser.

The polarizing Denver quarterback wound up throwing for 316 yards, which, if you toss in a colon in the right spot, mirrors the call number of a famous bible verse, John 3:16. That's a verse Tebow occasionally wrote on his face while playing at the University of Florida, Fox News reports. Not weird enough for you? Well, Tebow threw those 316 yards over the course of 10 completions, meaning he averaged 31.6 yards per completion. Wait, there's more: John Ourand of the Sports Business Journal tweeted that the TV rating for the last 15 minutes of the game was—you guessed it—a 31.6.

According to Coleman and his lawsuit, owner Joel Dahl told him all employees were required to partake in regular Bible study sessions led by a Christian pastor during the work day, while on the clock. \n \n Coleman told Dahl that the requirement was illegal, but Dahl wouldn’t budge, according to the lawsuit. In order to keep his job, Coleman obliged for nearly six months but ultimately told Dahl he couldn’t go, the suit says. \n \n “I said ‘I’ve kept an open mind, and it’s just not my thing.’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m going to have to replace you,'” Coleman told The Oregonian/OregonLive. \n \n “He said ‘You’re not going to tell me how to run my own company,’” Coleman continued. “I said ‘I’m not trying to tell you how to run your own company, but you’re not going to tell me what god to pray to.’” \n \n Coleman said his religious beliefs are indigenous: He’s half Caucasian and half Native American, with Cherokee and Blackfoot heritage. \n \n Coleman worked for the small construction company from October 2017 to this past April, when he was fired, the suit states. \n \n “This is so illegal,” said Corinne Schram, a Portland attorney representing Coleman. “Unless you are a religious organization like a church, you cannot force your employees to participate in religious activities.” \n \n Dahl's Albany attorney, Kent Hickam, doesn't dispute that Dahl requires all of his employees to attend Bible study, but says it’s legal because Dahl pays them to attend. \n \n “Mr. Dahl feels that it’s unfortunate that he (Coleman) is now trying to exploit Mr. Dahl’s honorable intentions for unjustified financial gain,” Hickman said. \n \n Dahl told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he’d struggled with drugs and alcohol and served time in prison for attempted second-degree assault. He said he’s been clean and sober for seven years. He started his company in 2016, with the idea of helping other convicted felons or people who’ve battled addictions rebuild their lives. \n \n “I’m a second-chance employer,” Dahl said. (Joel Dahl says he’s not related to another second-chance employer, Dave Dahl of Dave’s Killer Bread.) \n \n God is a big part of Joel Dahl’s life. The company's Facebook page features photos of recently completed home remodels -- often alongside praise to God or Jesus. \n \n After stripping a 106-year-old home down to the studs and renovating it to look brand new, one post states: “Fixing up this old house at times I was discouraged ‘cause there was so much to fix. But Me and God did this together and we got er done.” \n \n Another post expresses gratitude for the work that has come to Dahled Up Construction: \"Just finished these 2 roofs ... Look at God go. He is so awesome.” \n \n Coleman said he’s served prison time for delivery of methamphetamine and child neglect but has now been clean and sober for nearly four years. Earlier this week, he won back full custody of his two children, he said. \n \n Coleman’s past left him fearful that he wouldn’t be able to find other work, so he said stuck with the weekly, hourlong Bible study sessions for six months, until he took a stance and said he wouldn’t go. \n \n Coleman's legal team has started a web page, where it plans to offer updates about the case. Members of the public can also sign the page, in a show of support for Coleman. The page can be viewed here. \n \n The lawsuit was filed last week in Linn County Circuit Court. Read the lawsuit here. \n \n -- Aimee Green \n \n agreen@oregonian.com \n \n o_aimee ||||| ALBANY, Ore. – A man is suing an Albany construction company claiming he was fired for not attending Bible study. \n \n Ryan Coleman said he was hired by Dahled Up Construction Inc. in October 2017. Soon after he started working there, he said he discovered his boss Joel Dahl required employees to attend a Christian Bible study during work time. \n \n Coleman, who is not a practicing Christian, told Dahl he was not comfortable attending and that it was it illegal for him to require his employees to do so. \n \n However, he said Dahl insisted he attend. Coleman said he believed he had no other choice and went to the Bible study in order to keep his job. \n \n In April, Coleman said he once again told Dahl on the phone that he had a right not to attend the Bible study, and was then fired by Dahl. \n \n Coleman claims Dahl and his company discriminated against him due to his religious beliefs and is asking for $800,000 in damages. \n \n Dahl’s attorney Kent Hickman told the Oregonian that Dahl does require all his employees to attend Bible study and said it is legal because he pays them to attend.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAn Oregon man who says he was fired from his construction job for refusing to attend Christian Bible study is appealing to a higher power: the court. In a lawsuit filed this month, Ryan Coleman, 34, says he didn't find out about the weekly Bible study requirement until after Joel Dahl of Albany-based Dahled Up Construction hired him as a painter in late 2017, OregonLive reports. He says he went along with it for about six months before telling Dahl, \"It's just not my thing.\" Dahl's response, per Coleman, \"He said, 'well, I'm going to have to replace you.\" That was in April, KEZI reports. Now, Coleman is seeking $800,000—$50,000 in lost earnings and $750,000 for \"severe emotional distress, anguish, humiliation, anger, shame, and anxiety,\" per the lawsuit's ironically titled \"prayer for relief.\" Dahl's attorney, accusing Coleman of seeking \"unjustified financial gain,\" concedes that Dahled Up employees are required to go to Bible study. But it's legal, he argues, because they're still on the clock when they attend. Colman's attorney disagrees: \"This is so illegal,\" she says, adding that only religious organizations could have such a requirement.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nColorado passed a medical aid in dying measure Tuesday that will allow adults suffering from terminal illness to take life-ending, doctor-prescribed sleeping medication. \n \n The ballot initiative passed overwhelmingly, by a two-thirds, one-third split, according to unofficial returns. Supporters claimed victory an hour after polls closed in Colorado. \n \n “Today is bittersweet for our family,” said Melissa Hollis Brenkert, who watched her sister die painfully from a brain tumor. “Passage of Prop 106 means that Coloradans will now have options when facing pain and suffering at the end of their lives.” \n \n Opponents, though, vowed to keep fighting to protect the elderly and people with disabilities, who they said are the law’s targets. “We are deeply disappointed and concerned about Colorado legalizing doctor-assisted suicide,” said Jeff Hunt, vice president of public policy for Colorado Christian University. “The fight is not over.” \n \n Proposition 106, the “End of Life Options” measure, models Oregon’s “Death with Dignity” law, passed 22 years ago. With 87 percent of votes counted, the initiative had 1,508,202 votes, or 64.5 percent, compared with 827,676 or 35.4 percent, against. \n \n Two physicians would have to agree the person is mentally competent and has fewer than six months to live, and the person choosing to die would have to self-administer the dosage of secobarbital, historically used in low doses as a sleeping pill. People with dementia or Alzheimer’s would not be eligible for the prescription. \n \n “My dad wanted this option for peace of mind in his dying days and, ultimately, for the opportunity of a gentle passing,” said Julie Selsberg, who worked on the campaign. “Now we know that Coloradans believe that offering the option of medical aid in dying is the kind, compassionate, safe and just thing to do.” \n \n The measure was among the most emotionally charged initiatives on the state ballot. Colorado would join four other states that have followed Oregon with similar laws or court action — Washington, Vermont, Montana and California. \n \n The “Yes on Colorado End-of-Life Options” campaign has raised $4.8 million, including from Compassion & Choices Action Network. The face of the campaign was Brittany Maynard, who chose to die under Oregon’s law in 2014 instead of letting an aggressive brain tumor continue to “torture her to death.” Her husband, Dan Diaz, has spent the last two years talking to lawmakers and working with Compassion & Choices to change law in other states. He and Brittany had to move to Oregon from California so she could die peacefully, he said. \n \n Opponents said the proposal lacks safeguards — it does not require that a doctor is present at time of death, does not prevent “doctor shopping,” and does not prevent an heir from plotting the death of a relative to gain inheritance. The Archdiocese of Denver donated $1.1 million to the “No Assisted Suicide Campaign,” and said “human life is sacred at every stage and should be protected.” \n \n Some advocates for the disabled community also were opposed, saying such a law could lead insurance companies to determine it is more cost-effective to provide medical aid in dying than lifelong medical care. \n \n Even the language used on campaign signs and in television ads this fall has been controversial. People in favor of the initiative use the terms “dying with dignity” and “right to die,” but named their Colorado ballot measure the more neutral “end-of-life options. Opponents of the proposed law call it “physician-assisted suicide.” \n \n The Secretary of State’s Office listed the measure as “medical aid in dying,” which is the term physicians are likely to use. ||||| Terminally ill people with six months or less left to live will be able to buy medicine to end their lives thanks to a vote Tuesday. \n \n 9NEWS is projecting that Proposition 106 will pass. \n \n ELECTION RESULTS \n \n The measure was modeled after Oregon’s “Death with Dignity” law that’s been in place for the last two decades. Five states in the U.S. have laws like this. \n \n “This is a historic day for all Coloradans, and an especially tremendous victory for terminally ill adults who worry about horrific suffering in their final days,” Compassion & Choices Action Network President Barbara Coombs Lee said in a statement. “We are delighted the significant investment paid off and are proud to have lent the expertise and resources to empower the voters of Colorado. We congratulate Colorado for becoming the sixth state where more people have peace of mind at the end of life and fewer suffer unnecessarily.” \n \n Compassion and Choices, a national group based in Denver, backed the measure. The opposition was primarily funded by Catholic organizations. \n \n Copyright 2016 KUSA\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nProposition 106 has passed in Colorado, making the state the nation's sixth to legalize assisted suicide, reports 9NEWS. Adults who are terminally ill, with less than six months to live, and found to be mentally competent, can request life-ending medication—a high dose of secobarbital used in sleeping pills—from a doctor, reports the Denver Post; those with dementia or Alzheimer's aren't eligible. The measure passed with two-thirds support with 63% of votes counted, per the Post. Advocates called it a \"tremendous victory,\" while \"disappointed\" critics promised that \"the fight is not over.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nEach Monday, this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries, events and people that continue to affect the history being made today. \n \n The world map might look differently had the Greek volcano Thera not erupted 3,500 years ago in what geologists believe was the single-most powerful explosive event ever witnessed. \n \n Thera didn't just blow a massive hole into the island of Santorini – it set the entire ancient Mediterranean onto a different course, like a train that switched tracks to head off in a brand new direction. \n \n Minoan culture, the dominant civilization in the Mediterranean at the time, crumbled as a result of the eruption, historians believe, changing the political landscape of the ancient world indefinitely. Environmental effects were felt across the globe, as far away as China and perhaps even North America and Antarctica. \n \n The legend of Atlantis and the story of the Biblical plagues and subsequent exodus from Egypt have also been connected to the epic catastrophe. \n \n Dwarfed the atomic bomb \n \n Historians and archaeologists have had trouble deciding on the year Thera erupted, with dates ranging anywhere from 1645 BC to 1500 BC. Studies of ash deposits on the ocean floor have revealed, however, that when the volcano did blow, it did so with a force dwarfing anything humans had ever seen or have seen since. \n \n There are no first-person accounts of what happened that day, but scientists can compare it to the detailed records available from the famous eruption of Krakatoa, Indonesia, in 1883. \n \n That fiery explosion killed upwards of 40,000 people in just a few hours, produced colossal tsunamis 40 feet tall, spewed volcanic ash across Asia, and caused a drop in global temperatures and created strangely colored sunsets for three years. The blast was heard 3,000 miles away. \n \n Thera's eruption was four or five times more powerful than Krakatoa, geologists believe, exploding with the energy of several hundred atomic bombs in a fraction of a second. \n \n An absence of human remains and valuables like metal suggest that the Minoan residents of Santorini predicted the eruption and the island was evacuated, but the culture as a whole did not fare as well. \n \n Based on the nearby island of Crete, the powerful Minoan civilization declined suddenly soon after Thera blew its top. Tsunamis spawned by the eruption would have swamped its naval fleet and coastal villages first off, historians think. A drop in temperatures caused by the massive amounts of sulphur dioxide spouted into the atmosphere then led to several years of cold, wet summers in the region, ruining harvests. The lethal combination overran every mighty Minoan stronghold in less than 50 years. \n \n In just a short time, their peaceful, efficient bureaucracy made way for the warring city-state system of ancient Greece to dominate the Mediterranean. The Aegean would turn out to be a fundamental building block for the history of Europe, and the Minoan decline changed its early foundation completely. \n \n Famous legends \n \n Thera didn't just alter the cultural make up of Europe, it has kept adventurers and treasure hunters busy too. \n \n When the Greek philosopher Plato described the lost city of Atlantis over a thousand years after the volcanic eruption, he may have been referring to Thera folklore passed down in Greece over many generations and exaggerated like a game of broken telephone. \n \n The eruption has also been loosely linked with the Biblical story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt. The effects of Thera's eruption could have explained many of the plagues described in the Old Testament, including the days of darkness and polluting of the rivers, according to some theories. ||||| Credit: Danny Alvarez/Shutterstock \n \n If Aleppo's death toll is mistaken, the earthquake that hit Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010, may be a contender for the top 10 deadliest disasters. Even in a modern mass disaster, though, estimating the death toll is a tricky business. \n \n In the year after the quake, the government of Haiti estimated that the magnitude-7.0 quake and its aftermath killed 230,000 people; in January 2011, officials revised the figure to 316,000. Those figures are highly disputed, however. A 2010 study published in the journal Medicine, Conflict and Survival put the number at around 160,000 deaths. A 2011 U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) draft report from 2011 claimed even lower numbers — between 46,000 and 85,000. \n \n The disparities reflect the difficulty of counting deaths even in the modern era, not to mention the political wrangling that goes on over \"official\" numbers. Many critics of Haiti's estimates argue that the government revised the death toll up in order to secure further international aid. On the other side of the argument, according to the Columbia Journalism Review, were those who accused USAID of leaking the report to discredit the Haitian government.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\n\"The single-most powerful explosive event ever witnessed\" took place somewhere between 1645 BC and 1500 BC, when the volcano Thera erupted on what's now the island of Santorini. LiveScience reports its power has been likened to that of an 1883 eruption in Indonesia that could be heard 3,000 miles away and killed some 40,000 people. No such count is available for the Thera explosion, which is why it doesn't make LiveScience's list of the 11 deadliest natural disasters \"for which reasonably accurate death tolls exist.\" It includes the 2004 Indian Ocean quake and tsunami, which hit Indonesia hardest and killed as many as a quarter of a million people overall. Here are five disasters that didn't strike so recently: 526 Antioch quake: The best estimate comes from John Malalas, a Greek chronicler from the Byzantine city where the quake struck whose writings from the time put the toll at about 250,000. A 2007 paper noted that the temblor's May timing was inopportune as the city's population was swollen with tourists there for Ascension Day, resulting in an elevated toll. 1556 Shaanxi earthquake: As far as earthquakes go, this is pretty much the worst. Believed to have been about a magnitude 8, it is said to have demolished a 621-square-mile region of China's Shaanxi province on Jan. 23 of that year, killing some 830,000 people. 1839 India cyclone: Some 20,000 ships were wiped out by the cyclone and resulting storm surge that struck the port city of Coringa on Nov. 25, but that number pales in comparison to the estimated death toll: 300,000 people. 1920 Haiyuan earthquake: The US Geological Survey believes that this quake that hit central China on Dec. 16 of that year registered as a magnitude 7.8. Landslides were a big contributor to the death toll, which researchers in 2010 estimated as 273,400. 1931 Central China Floods: Pegged by LiveScience as the deadliest of all natural disasters, this one spanned the months of July and August. The estimated ranges of those killed is a huge one, but the number is big regardless: Somewhere between 2 million and 3.7 million were killed when the Yangtze River flooded due to strong rains and melting snow, affecting some 70,000 square miles.

Robin and I decided to start this page for our conjoined twins that we are having. Although we are learning everyday about them what we can tell you is this...They are thriving and growing well, and seem to be very active right now. They have two heads . But seem to be sharing one body. With one set of arms and legs. As for internally we still don't fully understand what is conjoined. But we are still learning more as the twins grow. Each doctors visit is some little piece of new information. We would also like to say that we are a strong Christian family. We believe that this is a gift from God no Matter what the out come is, and we want to safe guard the lives of our twins. So we will go full term. We love our babies and will go to ends of what we need to so that our babies survive. ||||| They survived a risky birth, but the conjoined Hamby twins’ heart was simply not strong enough. Asa and Eli died Friday afternoon, one day after their birth, according to their parents. \n \n In a video posted late Friday on Facebook, Michael and Robin Hamby said their sons fought hard before they were taken off ventilators at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. The twins died around 5 p.m., Michael Hamby said. \n \n “Robin got over there and we got to hold them, love on them and sing to them,” Michael said. “I miss them, even though I have only got to be with them 24 hours. Feels like a lifetime. I don’t wish this hurt on anybody.” \n \n At 7:32 a.m. Thursday, Robin Hamby delivered the twins at Northside Hospital by C-section. Asa and Eli arrived breathing on their own and crying, their parents said. But the boys’ health deteriorated Friday, and Robin was taken by ambulance from Northside to Egleston to be with the twins. \n \n The Hambys, of Ladonia, Ala., have said they relied on their faith throughout the pregnancy, and remained hopeful the boys could beat the odds. Born at 37 weeks, Asa and Eli shared a torso, arms and legs. \n \n Recommended for you Recommended for you Recommended for you Most read \n \n Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, but between 40 and 60 percent arrive stillborn, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Being joined side-by-side made the Hamby twins even rarer, a condition known as dicephalic parapagus. \n \n The Hamby’s chronicled the pregnancy and the boys’ birth on Facebook, posting frequent video updates. Within hours of their births, the twins made national headlines, along with photo from the delivery room showing Robin smiling at the boys’ tiny faces. \n \n Later Thursday, Asa and Eli were transported to Egleston for further evaluation, their parents said. The boys were holding their own until they began experiencing heart problems Friday, Michael Hamby said. \n \n “The doctors and the nurses at Egleston were awesome,” Robin Hamby said. “They explained everything they did. They did everything they could possibly do for them.” \n \n Though their lives were short, Asa and Eli touched many lives and won’t be forgotten, their parents said. \n \n “They looked so much like Michael,” Robin said. “They were just the cutest little things. So, so sweet.” \n \n In addition to their parents, Asa and Eli are survived by their 22-month-old sister, Selah, and numerous other relatives. Funeral arrangements have not been made.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA pair of conjoined twins in Atlanta have died one day after their birth, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Dad Michael Hamby announced the news via Facebook in a video last night. “Robin got over there and we got to hold them, love on them and sing to them,” he said. “I miss them, even though I have only got to be with them 24 hours. Feels like a lifetime. I don’t wish this hurt on anybody.” Asa and Eli shared a torso, arms, and legs, and because they also shared a heart, their chances of survival were low. Still, the boys had defied the odds simply by being born—about half of conjoined twins are stillborn, and most such twins are girls, notes WXIA. “They looked so much like Michael,” said Robin. “They were just the cutest little things. So, so sweet.” The Hambys, who live in Ladonia, Ala., have a 22-month-old daughter.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nClick here to read the latest press release about SLDN's 19th Annual National Dinner, which honored Lady Gaga for her commitment to equality with the Randy Shilts Visibility Award, or watch the video now. \n \n Lady Gaga brings the fight to the Senate!

A Taiwanese art collector stuck in the 0.8-mile tunnel Wednesday found that out firsthand when the taxi she was in was looted, with the thieves nabbing a handbag containing $5.4 million in Chanel jewelry, Sky News notes. Reported among the stolen gems was a $1.8 million ring. Police say they aren't sure if the perps targeted the victim or if they just lucked out in focusing on that car, the BBC notes. Initial reports indicated the jewels were destined for the city's Museum of Modern Art, though the museum has denied that, per the BBC. A police source tells Sky that these types of raids are \"often local delinquency. They ... know the area and escape through emergency exits.\" But dumping the jewels for a big payday could prove difficult for the thieves: The gems were numbered, so only those with a solid contact network would be able to sell them easily, the police source adds. As a source puts it to Sky, \"Either it was an order or they are in the s---.\" (This raid comes just two weeks after a London heist that may have netted thieves $300 million worth of stolen goods.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

But a letter from the USDA to Foster said cockroaches were observed at a hand wash sink near an inspection station. \n \n The agency pulled the inspectors from the plant, which effectively shuts down the operation. \n \n Foster Farms officials confirmed the shut-down in a statement Wednesday, saying they temporarily stopped operations \"to allow for enhanced sanitizing to take place.\" \n \n \"The plant treatment took place this afternoon and the company expects to fully resume operation once approved for inspection by FSIS,\" officials said in a statement. \n \n Company officials later issued an updated statement in which they acknowledged cockroaches were discovered at the plant on Wednesday and four other incidents going back to September 2013. The statement said the company maintains an ongoing pest control program. \n \n \"No other facilities are affected. No products are affected. Product production has been transferred to the company’s other facilities,\" the updated statement said. \n \n Cockroaches are considered pests that can carry bacteria, including salmonella. Tarr said that Wednesday's shutdown was not related to the ongoing outbreak. \n \n FSIS in October threatened to close the Livingston plant and two others in Fresno, Calif., but agreed to allow the firm to remain open while officials put a new multi-step process in place for salmonella control. \n \n Throughout both salmonella outbreaks, Foster Farms officials issued no recalls of potentially tainted products, instead advising consumers to handle chicken properly and to cook it thoroughly to a temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ||||| A US chicken factory, linked to a recent salmonella oubreak, has been shut down after inspectors found live cockroaches for the fourth time in five months. \n \n US Federal inspectors halted processing at the Foster Farms plant in California following the discovery of \"an infestation of live cockroaches,\" a suspension notice sent by the United States Department of Agriculture said. \n \n The letter, addressed to Farm Foods CEO Ron Foster, said the latest find demonstrated that the firm had \"failed to maintain an effective pest control program ... to assure that wholesome, unadulterated meat and poultry products are produced.\" \n \n It said the insects had been discovered at the Livingston plant on four separate occasions between August 1, 2013 and January 8, 2014. They were found in several areas including a sink used for hand washing and a sanitiser dispenser box in meat production areas. \n \n The plant is one of three in central California being investigated over a nationwide salmonella outbreak, newspaper USA Today reported. \n \n According to the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, 416 people across 23 states have been made ill by the ongoing outbreak, the newspaper said. \n \n Studies have found that cockroaches carry viruses and bacteria, including salmonella. \n \n In a statement, Foster Farms confirmed that the Livingston plant had been closed for \"sanitisation and treatment\". It said the treatment had now been completed and the factory was ready for further inspection. \n \n The company added that the Livingston discovery was an \"isolated incident\" and \"no other facilities were affected\". \n \n \"A single incident is not acceptable, and we are committed to a zero tolerance policy,\" the statement said. \n \n Foster Farms is the sixth-largest chicken processor in the United States. \n \n :: Watch Sky News live on television, on Sky channel 501, Virgin Media channel 602, Freeview channel 82 and Freesat channel 202.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\n\"Cockroach\" and \"infestation\" are two words you don't want anywhere near your dinner, but the USDA says it encountered just that at a California poultry plant that it wasted no time in shutting down yesterday. Foster Farms said that it immediately conducted \"enhanced sanitizing\" at its Livingston plant, and said it \"expects to fully resume operation\" as soon as the USDA can re-inspect the facility. It added that it was \"committed to a zero tolerance policy\" and that this was an \"isolated incident.\" Ick factor aside, cockroaches are known to carry salmonella and the plant in question is one of three Foster Farms facilities linked to a salmonella outbreak that sickened hundreds of Americans last year, NBC reports. Maybe not so \"isolated:\" Food Safety and Inspection Services inspectors said they found the bugs on four different occasions between August and yesterday, notes Sky News. In a letter, the USDA said Foster Farms \"failed to maintain an effective pest control program ... to assure that wholesome, unadulterated meat and poultry products are produced.\" Foster Farms is the nation's No. 6 poultry processor; NBC notes that it issued no recalls during last year's salmonella outbreak. Rather, consumers were warned to properly handle and cook their chicken.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Witnesses saw Kalman slide over the precipice around 2:45 p.m. \n \n Park personnel, aided by a California Highway Patrol helicopter, were unable to find Kalman on Saturday afternoon or evening, calling off their efforts as darkness fell. They returned in the morning, with about 20 searchers and several trained dogs scouring the boulders below the waterfall. \n \n Video: Sacramento Teen Swept Over Falls in Yosemite A 19-year-old Sacramento boy was swept over Nevada Fall in Yosemite on Saturday afternoon. Sonseeahray Tonsall reports. Media: San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Park officials closed part of the Mist Trail, from the footbridge above Emerald Pool to the top of Nevada Fall, to aid the search. \n \n The stretch of the Merced River that runs behind Yosemite's Half Dome has a long history of tragedy. \n \n Descending from the high Sierra back country to the Yosemite Valley floor in a series of sharp falls and boulder-strewn flumes, the Merced's currents are deceptively strong, even in dry years. The Mist Trail, which follows the river's course past Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall, can draw 2,000 people per day, and many are tempted to wade in, despite signs urging them to stay out of the water. \n \n Last year, two brothers — aged 6 and 10 — died after their family waded into the river near the Vernal Fall footbridge. In 2011, three friends from a Modesto-area church group were wading in the pool above Vernal Fall when they lost their footing and were swept over the edge, plunging 317 feet to their deaths. \n \n According to park officials, Kalman had been swimming above Nevada Fall, where the river pools in a basin of smooth stone. Kalman was swimming back from a rock in the middle of the river when the current caught him. \n \n Park officials estimated the river's flow at 500 cubic feet per second on Saturday, fed by new snowmelt. On Sunday, the river was running at 650 cubic feet per second, with water temperatures in the low 50s. \n \n Yosemite National Park averages 12 to 15 fatalities each year, roughly divided in half between accidents and other deaths such as heart attacks. Last month, a 73-year-old hiker from Minnesota fell from a cliff near the top of Vernal Fall and died on the rocks below. \n \n David R. Baker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The Sacramento teenager was visiting the park with a church group. Authorities say the river was running a \"very swift and powerful spring flow of water\" when he was swept over and they believe it would have been impossible to survive the fall, CNN reports. Two brothers, ages 6 and 10, died after being swept away in the same river last year, and the year before, three members of a church group died after being swept over another Merced River waterfall.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nWeeeellllll, so much for our #RelationshipGoals... \n \n It's a decade and done for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nrubinstein  taybi syndrome ( rsts ) or broad thumb - hallux syndrome was initially described by michail et al . in 1957 . \n the frequent clinical findings in patients with acc are mental retardation, visual problems, speech delay, seizures, and feeding problems ( in our patient it is seizure ) \n a 4 years and 6 months old female child presented to pediatric outdoor with a chief complaint of fever for 1-month with vomiting and lethargy . \n she had no history of hemoptysis, rapid weight loss, prolonged headache, or severe vomiting . \n the child was suffering from repeated attacks of fever and respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization from infancy . on day seven of life, she had seizure and was treated in local hospital . that was followed by head banging movements which persisted for 1-year . \n she had significant morphological abnormality with hypertelorism, beaked nose, downward slanting, high arched palate, broad thumb and big toe, enlarged palmer web, dental malalignment, hyperextensive joints, head circumference less than 50 percentile etc . \n all vitals were stable except mild fever which was measured to be 100.5 f. child had significant mental retardation, abnormal slurring speech, incoordination while transferring things from one hand to other and some behavioral anomaly . \n routine blood investigation revealed hb to be 7.4 mg / dl, malarial parasite antigen immuno - chromatographic test ( optimal - antigen ) was negative . \n erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 on 1 hr . all other blood pictures were normal . \n basing on all clinical features and morphological abnormality, the child was diagnosed as rsts with acc with enteric fever . \n she was treated by intravenous antibiotics, and the fever disappeared on 4 day of treatment . \n facial profile of rubinstein  taybi syndrome classical broad thumb magnetic resonance imaging showing agenesis of corpus callosum and polymicrogyria \n rsts is the only disorder known to be associated with germline mutations in creb - binding protein region ( crebbp ) and ep300 . \n cause is unclear but microdeletion of 16p 13.3 region in the crebbp has been found in some patients, suggesting it to be the cause of the syndrome . \n it produces galaxy of clinical features among them the craniofacial ( down slanting palpebral fissures, high arched palate, and beaked nose with the columella extending below the nares, grimacing smile, and talon cusps ) and limb symptoms are the most common . \n along with it ophthalmic features like strabismus, refractory errors, ptosis, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, cataracts, coloboma, nystagmus, glaucoma, and corneal abnormalities are not rare . \n orthopedic issues include dislocated patellas, lax joints, spine curvatures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and cervical vertebral abnormalities . \n dental problems include crowding of teeth, malocclusion, multiple caries, natal teeth, and talon cusps on the upper incisors of the secondary dentition . \n tumors reported in individuals with rsts include meningioma, pilomatrixoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, oligodendroglioma, leiomyosarcoma, and leukemia . \n short attention span, decreased tolerance for noise and crowds, impulsivity, and moodiness are frequently observed . \n other abnormal behaviors included attention problems, hyperactivity, self - injurious, and aggressive behaviors . \n the association of corpus callosum and rsts is very rare and scantily reported . in a review of the embryology of the corpus callosum \n true acc include ( 1 ) defects where axons form, but are unable to cross the midline because of absence of the massa commissuralis and lead large aberrant longitudinal fiber bundles known as probst bundles along the medial hemispheric walls ;

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA Mississippi woman has been charged in a second death related to giving buttocks-enhancing injections without being trained or licensed. \n \n The state attorney general's office says 53-year-old Tracey Lynn Garner of Jackson, formerly known as Morris Garner, was arrested Thursday and charged with one count of depraved heart murder. Conviction carries a potential life sentence. \n \n The release says Garner injected \"a silicone substance\" into Marilyn Hale of Selma, Ala., on Jan. 13, 2010, and Hale later died. \n \n Records show Garner was in the Hinds County Detention Center on Monday. Her attorney, John Colette, was not immediately available. \n \n Garner had been on house arrest awaiting trial in a similar case in the 2012 death of an Atlanta woman. |||||  Morris Garner, a Jackson man who lives as a woman under the name Tracey Lynne Garner, will face murder charges in the death of an Atlanta woman. \n \n The specific charge of depraved heart murder stems from Garner's role in allegedly injecting 37-year-old Karima Gordon with \"a foreign and possible counterfeit substance during an illegal medical procedure,\" according to Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. \n \n If convicted of depraved heart murder, defined as demonstrating \"callous disregard for human life\" and resulting in death, Garner could get life in prison. \n \n Hood's office said Garner performed the procedure at his home in Jackson. Garner's arrest resulted from a six-month-long investigation by the Mississippi AG's office, Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \n \n “While this remains a murder case, our intellectual property task force is involved to also investigate the possibility that the substance injected into the victim was a counterfeit version of silicone,” Hood said in a statement. \n \n The Associated Press reported that Hinds County Judge Melvin Priester denied bond after a hearing Tuesday afternoon. Garner was arrested Sept. 6, according to jail records. \n \n After the hearing, Garner's lawyer, John Colette, said he was \"shocked\" by the seriousness of the charge and the fact that his client was held without bond. He denied his client is guilty of depraved-heart murder. \n \n Garner said during court that he is 53-years-old and worked as a floral and interior designer. He wore a yellow prison jumpsuit and shackles, and his hair was in a short ponytail. \n \n Colette said Garner had undergone operations to change gender. Hood referred to Garner as a man, and Garner was booked into the Hinds County jail as a man. \n \n Hood said that Gordon, who had served in the military and wanted to become a model, found Garner after meeting someone on the Internet known to authorities only as \"Pebbles.\" Gordon met Pebbles in person in New York City and paid her $200 for the referral to Garner, according to Hood. \n \n Hood said his investigators were looking for Pebbles. \n \n The Associated Press found a Twitter account in Gordon's name from which only one message had been sent, and it was to a Pebbelz Da Model in December. The Twitter account of Pebbelz Da Model had a link to an website by the same name. \n \n Pebblelz's YouTube page also has more than 1.7 million page views. However, Hood's office had no comment on whether Pebbelz Da Model is the same person his investigators were looking for. \n \n \"We've had people practicing medicine without a license, but nothing like this,\" Hood said. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this story.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nTracey Lynn Garner had already been charged with murder in one silicone butt injection death, and now she's been charged in a second, the Clarion-Ledger reports. Garner (who, authorities say, is a man also known as Morris Garner who lives as a woman) is accused of illegally injecting counterfeit silicone into two women, both of whom later died, despite the fact that she was neither trained nor licensed, the AP reports. She was first arrested last year after Karima Gordon died of a blood clot in her lung a few days after the injection. Now authorities say a similar thing happened in 2010 with a woman named Marilyn Hale. Officials say Gordon found someone named \"Pebbles\" on the Internet, met up with her and paid her $200, and was referred to Garner for the procedure. Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model, has also been charged in the case. Last year, the Jackson Free Press identified Garner as a floral and interior designer, and reported that she performed the procedures in her Mississippi home.\n#END SUMMARY"}

The blunder occurred on Feb. 20, when Frankfurt-based lender KfW, a German government-owned development bank, transferred $5.4 billion to four other banks, reports Deutsche Welle. Germany's central bank identified the mishap, which was caused by an \"experienced\" programmer's \"configuration error\" made while working on the bank's payment software, the FT reports. That contributed to the creation of an \"automatic loop\" in which duplicate payments were made. While the bank says it \"launched a comprehensive international and external investigation\" to identify the exact error and avoid ones like it moving forward, it says all the money was returned promptly. Two side notes most media are reporting: One, that newspaper Bild called KfW \"Germany's dumbest bank\" in 2008 after it transferred 320 million euros to Lehman Brothers on the day the US investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Second, that the German bank doesn't stand alone. In 2015 Deutsche Bank AG wrongly sent $6 billion to a hedge fund client, though it got the money back the next day. It happened when a junior foreign-exchange trader's boss was on vacation. Read about the mishap here.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nOnce upon a time 20 years ago, the average San Francisco home cost the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $400,000. All one had to do was own a million-dollar home (or $1.5 million today) and they could be confidently among San Francisco’s wealthy elite. Ah, it was a simpler time. \n \n But now? Heck, every house costs at least a million dollars. They even advertise it. And the average income for both individuals and families is climbing every year. It takes a lot more riches just to be rich anymore. \n \n So who's rich and who's not in this crazy market? To alleviate this burning question, the local branch of investment firm Charles Schwab commissioned a survey of a 1,000 Bay Area residents to see what they think.To wit: \"The survey of 1,000 Bay Area residents found that local residents think it takes about $2.5 million in most areas of the United States to be considered wealthy while a net worth of more than $6 million is what it takes to be wealthy in the Bay Area.\" \n \n Ignoring for a moment the idea that $2 million doesn’t qualify as rich most places anymore, imagine how embarrassing it must be for anyone worth $3 million to find out that they only rate as middle class in the Bay Area. What will the neighbors think? \n \n Of course, this was only a survey of people’s opinions, meaning it’s less a hard numbers look at the cost of living so much as a glimpse into how people are feeling these days. Eighty-six percent of those polled say that the cost of living in the region is too high, 55 percent say they have trouble meeting their financial goals, and 68 percent say the Bay Area has one of the worst housing markets in the country. \n \n (The other 32 percent are presumably sellers.) ||||| Charles Schwab study concludes that you need $6 million to be 'wealthy' in the Bay Area \n \n If you don't already feel poor living in the Bay Area, you will now. \n \n A new Charles Schwab survey says that in order to be considered \"wealthy\" in the Bay Area, you need a net worth of at least $6 million. A net worth of $1 million is the baseline for being \"comfortable.\" \n \n Excuse us while we take a quick break to cry into the $8 artisanal coffee that we really can't afford. \n \n Charles Schwab surveyed 1,000 Bay Area residents aged 21 to 75 in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Solano counties. The survey asked what residents considered enough money to be \"wealthy\" vs. \"comfortable.\" \n \n Respondents said they believed $2.5 million was the average needed to be wealthy in other parts of the country. \n \n Unsurprisingly, the survey also found that locals are shocked by the cost of living here. Eighty-six percent said the cost of living is \"unreasonable\" and 55-percent said living in the Bay Area makes it \"difficult to reach their financial goals.\" Only two percent agreed strongly that the cost of living in the Bay Area is reasonable. Who these people are, exactly, remains a question. \n \n Off-setting those depressing statistics are upbeat outlooks on job opportunities. Eighty percent believe the region is a great place for career growth, 88-percent say it's a prime place for innovation and 70-percent say the Bay Area's economy is better than the national one. \n \n To read the full Charles Schwab study, click here.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nResidents of the Bay Area in California think it takes more than twice as much money to be considered wealthy there than in the rest of the country, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. A survey of 1,000 residents by Charles Schwab found you need to be worth more than $6 million in the Bay Area to be considered wealthy, but only $2.5 million in the rest of the country. They say it also takes $1 million to even be \"comfortable\" in the Bay Area. The survey found 86% of residents believe the Bay Area's cost of living to be unreasonable. The whole thing is bad news for both actual poor residents and \"Bay Area poor\" residents. \"Imagine how embarrassing it must be for anyone worth $3 million to find out that they only rate as middle class in the Bay Area,\" Curbed San Francisco notes. \"What will the neighbors think?\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

Maybe they aren’t supposed to touch the kids anymore. So we stood by and watched,” said Jason LeRoy Black Sr. \n \n Two white kids approached The Rabbit moments later. \n \n “[The] Rabbit showered, hugged, kissed and posed with them and took pictures. That made my kids feel horrible, it made us as adults feel horrible,” said Jason LeRoy Black Sr. \n \n The family said they immediately went to the management office to complain, showing them photos that they say indicate the rabbit was trying to avoid touching them. \n \n They filed an official complaint and were offered VIP passes, which they declined. \n \n Instead they’re asking Disney to make a public apology and terminate the employee in The Rabbit suit. \n \n “They’re not trying to get something they don’t deserve,” said their attorney Dan Gilleon. “In fact all they’ve asked for is a little bit of recognition that this should not have happened.” \n \n After months of correspondence with Disney asking them to sign a confidential waiver in exchange for $500, the Blacks have hired an attorney and are demanding surveillance video to prove or disprove their claims. ||||| It's a memorable part of parenthood -- when your child gets to meet their favorite character at an amusement park. But a family in San Diego says they were robbed of that special moment because a Disneyland employee was racist. \n \n This family has been battling with Disney since last August because they say the amusement park employee was racist -- and now they just want to make sure no other children go through this. \n \n \"I was going to hug him but he turned his back,\" said 6-year-old Jason Black. \n \n \"How'd that make you feel?\" \n \n \"Sad,\" replied Jason. \n \n The 6-year-old was shunned by his favorite character from Alice in Wonderland. All he wanted was a hug -- and his older brother Elijah just wanted to hold the rabbit's hand. \n \n \"The rabbit was turning his back on him like he didn't event want to touch him, I went up to try to hold his hand but he kept on flicking my hand off,\" said Elijah. \n \n \"Our first instinct was okay, maybe they have new policies, maybe they aren't supposed to touch the kids anymore so then we stood by and we watched,\" said father Jason Black Sr. \n \n What they saw led them to believe that the person playing Rabbit was racist. \n \n \"This white boy. He started hugging on the little girl and kissing... then hugging the boy and they were white,\" said Elijah Black. \n \n \"There were two other kids that came up and the rabbit showered them, hugged kissed them, posed with them, meanwhile that made my kids feel horrible,\" said Black Sr. \n \n The family immediately showed the photos to management and filed a complaint. Management offered VIP passes -- but the family turn down that offer, asking for an apology and termination of the employee instead. \n \n \"It's about the principle and what are you going to do to make the situation better so this doesn't happen to another family.\" \n \n After months of battling with Disney, the family has been asked to sign a confidential waiver in exchange for $500.

The caller told dispatchers that a man in a ski mask entered the bar with a gun.Sgt. Matt Schroeter arrived at the location and saw a man in a ski mask backing out the door. He appeared to be holding a weapon. The \"robber\" was actually actor Jim Duff, who was filming a scene for a movie.But Schroeter didn't know that.\"Drop the gun! Drop the gun now!\" Schroeter yells in body camera footage released after the incident. Duff then turns toward the officer and takes off his mask; Schroeter fires a shot and repeats his orders for Duff to drop his weapon.\"We're doing a movie,\" Duff says after taking off the ski mask and dropping the weapon.The officer then orders him to get on the ground. Duff complies and then yells to someone inside the bar, \"You guys better get out here, man.\"Someone starts to come out the door, but the officer tells them to stay inside.Police said neither the production company nor the bar owners told them that a movie was being shot in the area. It didn't help that the other actors and filming equipment were inside the business, making it difficult to know that a movie was being shot.Duff was placed into custody until police could confirm that he was part of a movie scene.\"We could not see the police, so when the actor left the building we had no knowledge any police had even arrived at the scene,\" Montgomery County Movies owner Philip Demoret told CBS4.No charges were filed in connection with the case. Demoret said he planned to work with Crawfordsville police so that something like this doesn't happen again.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nNote to movie makers: Give the police a heads-up when filming a robbery scene in public. Newly released police bodycam video released by the city of Crawfordsville, Ind., shows how close one actor came to learning that lesson in the worst possible way. Officers responded to a robbery call at a local bar when someone spotted a masked gunman entering. Cops arrived just as actor Jim Duff was stepping back out, holding a fake gun, and an officer fired a shot when he didn't immediately drop his weapon as ordered, reports ABC 7. Luckily, the bullet didn't hit him. \"We're doing a movie,\" Duff can be heard trying to explain as officers order him to get on the ground. Police ended up holding him in custody until they confirmed that he was, in fact, part of a movie being filmed. No charges will be filed related to the incident, reports the Journal & Courier. \"We ask, for obvious safety purposes, that our department be notified of future instances where toy or prop weapons are going to be used,\" said a city statement.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nConsumers can expect to pay more to get a mortgage next year, the result of changes meant to reduce the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play in the market. \n \n The mortgage giants said late Monday that, at the direction of their regulator, they will charge higher fees on loans to borrowers who don't make large down payments or don't have high credit scores—a group that represents a large share of home buyers. Such fees are... ||||| This Christmas holiday, a number of families will be allowed to stay in their homes for a short while longer. Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have both announced a two-week moratorium on evictions over the Christmas and New Year's holiday. Though the gesture seems benevolent and considerate, does it really mean that much? \n \n A brief respite \n \n From Dec. 18 through Jan. 3, residents of foreclosed single-family homes and two- to four-unit dwellings will be allowed to stay without disturbance from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The moratorium will only stand for actual evictions, as other administrative functions and proceedings will continue during the two-week period. In addition, the local eviction companies will be allowed to continue their administrative duties to prepare for the eviction at the end of the break. \n \n By looking at the most recent data from both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the firms have foreclosed on an average of 58,000 homes per quarter. The two-week moratorium may give up to 11,000 families nationwide the time they need to reach out to friends and family to make new living arrangements. \n \n Nothing new \n \n The moratorium is not a new occurrence for the mortgage giants. Each year they announce the same respite for beleaguered families. Though the families appreciate the gesture, investors shouldn't view the event as a real kindness that would cost the companies anything. Since the administrative and procedural steps will continue on schedule, the only difference to Freddie and Fannie will be the physical acquisition of the foreclosed property. \n \n Though Fannie and Freddie wouldn't be able to sell the foreclosed property before the eviction, that would possibly pose a slight delay for the firms, but the Christmas holiday is historically a slow time for property sales -- giving the GSEs very little downside for offering the moratorium. \n \n Season of giving \n \n Announcing the moratorium has given both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the opportunity to give some advice to troubled homeowners. Both firms have expressed their desire that borrowers who find themselves in trouble should seek help as soon as possible. Terry Edwards, chief operating officer for Fannie Mae, said, \"We encourage any homeowner who is having difficulty making their mortgage payment to reach out for help right away. Fannie Mae will continue to help borrowers avoid foreclosure whenever possible.\" Both GSEs have good records of helping troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure, with Freddie Mac saying eight out of 10 borrowers have been able to stay in their homes with the foreclosure alternatives it provides. \n \n Hopefully the extra time the families get from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's moratorium will be enough to allow them a happy holiday season. For investors, the mortgage giants' generosity should give you a little bit of the warm and fuzzies, without any concerns about their operations.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAn effort to loosen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's grip on the mortgage market will come at a price: pricier mortgages. The two announced late Monday that, at the insistence of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, they will increase their fees to borrowers without impeccable credit (designated as those with scores of 680 to 760 out of 850) or those making a down payment of less than 20%. The Wall Street Journal provides an example: A borrower making a 10% down payment and carrying a credit score of 735 would currently pay 0.75% of the loan amount in fees on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. In 2014, that would rise to 2%, a fee that the Journal calculates would raise the mortgage rate some 0.4 percentage points. And even those making a down payment of more than 20% will see the fees rise if they're in the so-so credit zone. The changes go live in March, but may start showing up earlier. The reason for the move: to make it more competitive for private investors, who \"target a higher rate of return\" and charge higher fees, to back mortgages. Fannie and Freddie back about two-thirds of America's mortgages, and a FHFA official says even the new rates will be lower than private ones. The Journal pairs that with some gloomy responses, such as this from Lewis Ranieri, credited with co-inventing the mortgage-backed security. He thinks the private sector isn't in a position to lend more yet, so \"you're just making housing less affordable.\" Meanwhile, Daily Finance provides a brief respite from the gloom, reporting that, as they do each holiday season, Fannie and Freddie won't evict residents of foreclosed single-family homes between today and Jan. 3—a move that could affect as many as 11,000 families.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nPresident Obama said today he is willing to compromise on the George W. Bush tax cuts to preserve them for the middle class. \n \n \"We've got to make sure that we're coming up with a solution, even if it's not 100% of what I want or what the Republicans want,\" Obama said in North Carolina. \"There's no reason that ordinary Americans should see their taxes go up next year.\" \n \n Obama spoke as aides and members of Congress said they are discussing a potential deal for a temporary extension of all the tax cuts, including those for individuals who make more than $200,000 annually and couples who make more than $250,000. \n \n The president, along with Vice President Biden, is scheduled to meet this afternoon with Democratic leaders to discuss the tax cut issue. \n \n Obama and other Democrats want an extension only for the middle class but do not have the votes to overcome a filibuster by Senate Republicans. \n \n Without some kind of deal, all of the George W. Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, meaning a de facto tax hike for everybody. \n \n \"A middle-class tax hike would be very tough, not only on working families, it would also be a drag on our economy at this moment,\" Obama told a crowed at Forsyth Community College in Winston-Salem, N.C. \n \n Any agreement must include an extension of unemployment benefits, Obama said, calling that \"a priority.\" \n \n Republicans such as Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. -- who is involved in talks with the White House -- said they want a permanent extension of all the tax cuts but may be willing to settle for temporary extensions instead. \n \n Kyl and other Republicans argue that no one's taxes should be raised in tough economic times and that wealthy taxpayers are the ones that create jobs. \n \n White House spokesman Bill Burton declined to comment on many specifics of the negotiations but did say they are going well. \n \n \"The president is confident that in the next couple of days or so we will find a way to extend tax cuts for middle-class families and do some other things that the president thinks are important in helping to grow the economy and create jobs,\" Burton said. \n \n Those other things include unemployment insurance, as well as middle-class tax breaks such as school tuition tax credits. \n \n \"As the president has been saying, he's not going to just sign an extension of these tax cuts,\" Burton said. \"He thinks that what we need to do is extend unemployment insurance and do some of these other tax credits that are so stimulative and help to both grow the economy and also help middle-class families who are really struggling right now.\" \n \n (Posted by David Jackson) ||||| President Obama conceded Monday that he’ll probably have to let the Bush tax cuts for the rich be extended as part of a deal with Republicans, arguing that such an agreement was necessary to ensure that taxes for the middle class don’t increase on Jan. 1. \n \n “We've got to make sure that we’re coming up with a solution, even if it’s not 100 percent of what I want or what the Republicans want,” he said during a speech about the economy at a North Carolina technical community college. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset VIDEO: Obama on tax cuts POLITICO 44 \n \n Obama insisted that the U.S. “can’t afford” to extend the tax cuts for the rich permanently, as Republicans desire — a move analysts say will add billions to the already massive federal deficit, but that the GOP argues will stimulate investment and small-business hiring. But the president signaled that he may have no choice other than to extend the breaks at least temporarily, as members of both parties in Congress wrangle over how to retain the expiring cuts as the year’s end deadline looms. \n \n “We've got to find consensus here,” Obama said. Allowing the tax cuts to expire across the board, he said, “would be very tough not only on working families. It would also be a drag on the economy at this moment. So I believe we should keep in place tax cuts for workers and small businesses that are set to expire.” \n \n He added, “There’s no reason that ordinary Americans should see their taxes go up next year.” \n \n Before he touched down in Winston-Salem, N.C., the president spent part of the morning calling lawmakers to shore up support for a deal on tax cuts to be reached by the end of the week, according to the White House. White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton told reporters aboard Air Force One that negotiators have made progress on a deal and that Obama was confident that one would be reached “in the next couple of days or so.” \n \n White House officials hinted on Monday that the president would not sign a compromise extension unless it included the continuation of long-term unemployment insurance and a slew of “stimulative” tax programs that were part of the 2009 Recovery Act. The president alluded to those proposals during his speech at Forsyth Technical Community College.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nFaced with the prospect of no deal on the Bush tax cuts resulting in a middle-class tax hike on Jan. 1, President Obama is signaling a willingness to extend them across the board, reports USA Today. \"We've got to find consensus here even if it's not 100% of what I want or what the Republicans want,\" he said in a speech today. \"There’s no reason that ordinary Americans should see their taxes go up next year.” The burgeoning federal deficit \"can't afford\" to permanently extend the tax cuts to the rich, the president said, but he looks ready to do so temporarily—though Politico notes that the White House has hinted that such a compromise must be tied to the extension of unemployment insurance and other stimuli in the 2009 Recovery Act.

Torstein Appfjell, who Sky News reports oversees about 2,000 reindeer, calls the deaths \"totally tragic\" and frames that toll in that period as \"unprecedented.\" Appfjell says the deadliest day was Saturday, when 65 were killed, reports the AP. Deutsche Welle has this tough detail: Per a documentary filmmaker who was on the scene, some animals were not killed upon impact and had to be shot. The animals are undertaking their winter migration, which sees them travel from mountainous pastures to the coast in search of food. It's a perilous journey, and deaths are not uncommon. Though Appfjell says train accidents previously killed a maximum of 250 reindeer over 12 months, Deutsche Welle reports a far higher toll, saying 2,000 have lost their lives along the northern railway line over the 2013 to 2016 period. Suggestions that a fence be added along the line have gone nowhere due to a lack of funding, though train drivers have now been told to reduce their speeds in the area.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\ndespite recent advances in imaging modalities, it is very difficult to distinguish benign lesions from malignant lesions presenting as polypoid lesions of the gallbladder ( plg ) . \n the current consensus regarding a treatment strategy for plg is that a solitary, sessile polyp larger than 1 cm and a patient older than 60 years should be removed surgically because it can mask malignancy . \n we treated a patient with an inflammatory polyp of the gallbladder mimicking early polypoid cancer and discuss this rare entity . \n a 69-year - old male was admitted to our hospital with a plg that was found incidentally . \n tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19 - 9 were also within normal range . \n ultrasonography ( us ) revealed a polypoid lesion with isodensity of the liver measuring 16 mm in maximum size in the fundus of the gallbladder . enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) demonstrated marked enhancement of the polyp, although it was not clearly detected on unenhanced ct ( fig . \n 1a ) . magnetic resonance imaging showed a subpedunculated and smooth - surfaced polyp with the upper two - thirds of its mass constricted . with a tentative diagnosis of early polypoid cancer of the gallbladder \n intraoperative us showed a mushroom - shaped polyp with hyperechoic spots on the surface and with an inner echopenic area ( fig . \n resected specimens revealed a smooth - surfaced polyp with the upper two - thirds of its mass constricted ( fig . \n histological study revealed a nonneoplastic polyp with edematous stroma and infiltration of lymphcytes and plasmacytes with partial formation of lymph follicles . \n atypical epithelium was not present, although the surface epithelium was complicated and intestinal metaplasia was found . \n a microscopic intramural calculus was present, although there were no macroscopic stones in the gallbladder ( fig . \n inflammatory polyps of the gallbladder are defined as tumor - like lesions in the category of benign tumors and tumor - like lesions of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts that have radiologic manifestations . among the tumor - like lesions of the gallbladder, inflammatory polyps are relatively rare, accounting for 1.4 to 12% of plg in recent published data ; hence cholesterol polyps comprise the majority of nonneoplastic polyps of the gallbladder . \n inflammatory polyps of the gallbladder histologically consist of vascular connective tissue containing inflammatory infiltrates, and there is hyperplastic epithelial invagination . \n these polyps appear to be the result of enlargement and fusion of villi due to chronic inflammation . in the present case, \n very few case reports of inflammatory polyps of the gallbladder have been published, so the typical characteristics of imaging findings have not been described precisely . \n this differentiation of ultrasonographic findings may depend on the size of the polyp ; the former measured 15  8 mm and the latter 8  3 mm . \n reported the presence of a hyperechoic line around the inflammatory polyp, as intraoperative us showed hyperechoic spots on the surface of the polyp in the present case . \n this finding probably depends on the difference of density originating from the complication of the epithelial surface of the polyp . \n endoscopic us showed, however, that hyperechoic spots were nonspecific findings for an inflammatory polyp because aggregations of hyperechoic spots, which represented multiple granules of cholesterosis, have also been recognized in a high percentage of cholesterol polyps . \n furukawa et al .   reported that not all cholesterol polyps and hyperplastic polyps were detected on unenhanced ct, and concluded that the configuration of polypoid lesions depicted on enhanced ct and visualization of them on unenhanced ct are helpful in differentiating neoplastic lesions that should be resected from other benign lesions . in conclusion, intraoperative us as well as endoscopic us could be helpful to differentiate benign polypoid lesions from malignant ones . \n the histological manifestation of inflammatory polyp of the gallbladder should guide the examination of us findings .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWe treated a 69-year - old male with a 16-mm polyp of the gallbladder . enhanced computed tomography demonstrated marked enhancement . with a tentative diagnosis of early polypoid cancer of the gallbladder \n, open cholecystectomy was performed . \n intraoperative ultrasound showed hyperechoic spots on the surface of the polyp with an inner echopenic area . \n the histological diagnosis was an inflammatory polyp that manifested nonneoplastic, edematous stroma, and infiltration of lymphcytes and plasmacytes .\n#END SUMMARY"}

Please try again later. ||||| Man pleads guilty to setting King Fire after selfie video emerges \n \n A 37-year-old man was sentenced to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to starting the 2014 King Fire, which burned a dozen homes and nearly 100,000 acres east of Placerville in the central Sierra. \n \n The case against Wayne Allen Huntsman of Pollock Pines (El Dorado County) was nailed down in part because of a selfie video that Huntsman made at the fire’s origin, the El Dorado County district attorney’s office said Friday. \n \n In the video, recorded Sept. 13, 2014, Huntsman is standing in a forested area between two separately lit blazes, which prosecutors construed as a sign that the fire was intentionally set. Although Huntsman says on his video, “I’m stuck in the middle,” he smiles and does not appear to be fearing for his safety. \n \n A retired firefighter picked up Huntsman after the blaze began. He saw Huntsman’s selfie and recorded it on his own phone, then turned over his video to law enforcement officials, who arrested Huntsman four days later. \n \n Huntsman was also caught on surveillance video, after starting the fire, stealing liquor from a local grocery store, prosecutors said. \n \n The fast-moving inferno burned for nearly a month across 97,717 acres of mostly mountainous terrain along Highway 50 in the El Dorado National Forest. Thousands were forced to evacuate. Damages were estimated in the tens of millions. \n \n Huntsman is originally from the Santa Cruz area, but he moved to Pollock Pines in June 2013 for work, family members told The Chronicle.

According to Reuters, Wayne Huntsman pleaded guilty to three counts of arson Friday for starting the 2014 King Fire in Northern California that took hundreds of firefighters a month to get under control. His sentence was increased because a number of firefighters were injured and 12 homes and dozens of other structures were destroyed. Thousands of residents were displaced by the fire. Huntsman originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. In September 2014, a retired firefighter picked Huntsman up escaping the area of the blaze, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Huntsman showed the man a video of himself standing between two fires. \"Listen, I got fire all around me,\" Huntsman says in the video. \"I'm stuck in the middle, babe.\" The man made a recording of the video and turned it over to the authorities, who arrested Huntsman within days. The DA says Huntsman was trying to look like a hero in the video, but it appeared the fires were purposefully set because there were two of them and Huntsman seemed to be enjoying himself. Meanwhile, Huntsman's sister is accused of killing two young children, whose bodies were found in a storage locker in Redding, California, according to SFist.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nClose Get email notifications on Kurt Hanson daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever Kurt Hanson posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. ||||| 1 of 20 View Caption \n \n (Scott Sommerdorf | The Salt Lake Tribune) Defendant Tyerell Joe Przybycien, 18, of Spanish Fork, returns to court follo...

What Tyerell Przybycien is charged with doing instead: helping her set up and carry out her suicide, the Daily Herald reports. On Tuesday, a 4th District Court judge ruled there was \"reasonable belief\" that enough evidence exists to send the Spanish Fork man to trial for Jchandra's death, charging him with first-degree murder and failure to report a dead body, both felonies. If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. In court documents cited in the Washington Post, prosecutors say when Jchandra told Przybycien of her plans, the 18-year-old texted another friend to ask what he should do, and the friend told him he should persuade her otherwise. Przybycien, however, reportedly had the reverse reaction. \"It be awesome,\" he texted back, noting he wanted to help her carry out her plan. \"Like getting away with murder.\" Those records also detail Przybycien's alleged role, including mapping out Jchandra's suicide, picking her up from work May 5, and buying rope and compressed air. He's then accused of taking Jchandra to the Maple Lake Campground in Payson, setting up a noose for her, and filming her as she inhaled the compressed air, passed out, and fell off a wooden pedestal, hanging herself in the process. The Salt Lake Tribune has reported he also provided running commentary through the video found on her cellphone, including noting at one point: \"That's when the brain stops getting oxygen.\" Przybycien's lawyer argues his client didn't actually carry out the actions that killed her, but Judge James Brady says Przybycien's help was a \"substantial factor\" in her death. Przybycien's arraignment is set for Oct. 24. (Radio host Delilah revealed the contents of her son's \"goodbye note.\")\n#END SUMMARY"}

The false missile alert and the state's failure to cancel it in a timely manner was a substantial factor in causing James Sean Shields' heart attack on Jan. 13, the lawsuit said. \n \n His girlfriend Brenda Reichel joined the lawsuit, having suffered \"emotional upset\" from watching him almost die on several occasions. Their lawsuit names the state of Hawaii and the then-administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, Vern Miyagi. \n \n The lawsuit also names unidentified state employees, individuals and entities responsible for the missile alert. The suit seeks unspecified damages. \n \n \"We're going to reserve any comment until we have had a chance to review the claims,\" said Richard Rapoza, a spokesman for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency State attorney general spokesman Krishna F. Jayaram said the office will review the complaint carefully and respond in due course. \n \n Miyagi declined to comment. A Hawaii Emergency Management Agency employee mistakenly sent the missile alert to cellphones and broadcasters on Jan. 13, triggering widespread panic until the agency sent another message 38 minutes later notifying people it was a false alarm. \n \n The lawsuit recounts how the couple was heading from their townhome in Hawaii Kai to Sandy Beach on that Saturday morning when they received the alert on their cellphones. \"Both plaintiffs believe this message to be true and were extremely frightened and thought they were shortly going to die,\" the lawsuit said. \n \n This smartphone screen capture shows a false incoming ballistic missile emergency alert sent from the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency system on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018. Caleb Jones / AP \n \n They decided if they were going to die, they might as well die together on the beach, the lawsuit said. Reichel's son, who is in the Hawaii Army National Guard, called her saying the threat was real and asked what they planned to do to seek shelter. \n \n The couple called their loved ones as they drove to the beach. Shields began to feel a severe and painful burning in his chest after he called his son and daughter. \n \n Shortly after, he went to a community clinic, where he suffered cardiac arrest. A doctor resuscitated him, while arriving paramedics assisted him further. \n \n He was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction or heart attack after he arrived at Straub Hospital, the lawsuit said. CBS affiliate KGMB-TV reports that paramedics responded to three other incidents that day that the patients or members of their family blamed on the missile alert. \n \n The other incidents were an 89-year-old man who fell, a 37-year-old woman in a car accident and a 38-year-old woman who was experiencing anxiety, KGMB-TV reports. ||||| “There are probably thousands of people out there who suffered either financial or physical injuries as a result of what happened,\" Rosenberg said. \"I’m aware, for example, of several car accidents that occurred on the day that the missile alert came up because people were rushing around trying to either get home or get to loved ones or get as far away from the downtown area as possible. So there are a number of car accidents. Those, in my opinion, are all attributable to the state.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA Hawaii man claims that a false alert about incoming ballistic missiles issued in that state earlier this year caused him to have a heart attack. On Jan. 13, Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency fired off an alert to cellphones warning, “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.” A lawsuit filed Tuesday says James Sean Shields and Brenda Reichel, both listed as plaintiffs, “believed the message to be true and were extremely frightened and thought they were going to die,” NBC reports. According to the suit, the pair, who lived in Honolulu, were heading to Sandy Beach when the alert came, per KGMB. “If they were going to die,” the suit says, “They might as well die together on the beach.” So they continued to the beach. Once they arrived, they began to call loved ones.” After calling his kids, Shields began to have severe chest pains, per CBS. He went to a clinic, where he suffered cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. Around the same time, some 30 minutes after the missile alert, the state sent another message saying the alert was sent in error. Per KGMB, the suit says that Shields hadn’t had any heart conditions previously. Vern T. Miyagi, former Emergency Management Agency administrator, as well as unnamed state employees are named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages. “We’re going to reserve any comment until we have had a chance to review the claims,\" a state attorney tells CBS. According to reports, an elderly man fell, a 37-year-old woman had a car accident, and a 37-year-old woman called 911 with anxiety in connection to the false alarm. (This man claims that licorice caused his heart problems.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Browne... (Associated Press) \n \n John Henry Browne has tried over 250 criminal cases to verdict, representing clients ranging from serial killer Ted Bundy to Colton Harris-Moore, known as the \"Barefoot Bandit.\" \n \n The 65-year-old said he has only handled three or four military cases. The soldier will also have at least one military lawyer. \n \n Browne has been a prominent figure in Washington state legal circles since the 1970s. Tall and stylish, he's known equally for his zeal in representing his clients and his flair before television cameras. \n \n He has handled some of the most high-profile criminal cases in state. In addition to being a lawyer for Bundy, in 1983 he helped Benjamin Ng avoid the death penalty following his conviction in Washington's worst mass killing, the massacre of 13 people at a Seattle restaurant. \n \n In one of his greatest legal victories, Browne ensured that a man who fled to Brazil after setting a fire that killed four firefighters would not face murder charges upon his return because the extraditing country _ Brazil _ did not have a felony murder statute equivalent to Washington's. \n \n Browne recently represented Colton Harris-Moore, who gained international attention for stealing airplanes, boats and cars during a two-year run from the law. Browne and his co-counsel, Emma Scanlan, helped Harris-Moore reach state and federal plea deals, then persuaded a state judge to give him the low end of the sentencing range: seven years in prison. \n \n Browne graduated from American University School of Law in 1971 and went on to be a Ford Foundation Fellow at Northwestern University School of Law. He began his legal career as an assistant attorney general in Olympia, Wash., the state capital.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWe still don't know the name of the US soldier accused of killing 16 people in Afghanistan, but one of his attorneys certainly has a high profile. Seattle's John Henry Browne tells the News Tribune of Tacoma that he will assist military attorneys with the defense. Browne has defended a slew of big-name clients, most recently the Barefoot Bandit. Years ago, he represented serial killer Ted Bundy, notes AP. He wouldn't divulge any information about the 38-year-old soldier, other than to say he's from the Tacoma area and sought out Browne via the military because of his reputation. “He’s from here, and he knows who I am,” Browne told the local newspaper, adding that the case is \"more political than legal.\" One possible avenue of defense is the brain injury that the soldier suffered on a previous tour of duty.\n#END SUMMARY"}

This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe U.S. housing sector is gradually returning to pre-crisis levels. Home prices rose for four consecutive years to a median of $222,400 at the end of 2015, the highest since 2007. Prices rose further in the second quarter — by 4.9% from the same time a year ago. With increased home values as well as continued job and income growth there are plenty of reasons for optimism in the U.S. economy. \n \n Not all U.S. housing markets, however, have returned to pre-crisis levels. According to data released in August by the National Association of Realtors, housing prices increased the most in the Western and Southern United States, while in the Northeast prices grew slowly, or declined. \n \n Based on median single-family home price changes over the year through the second quarter from the NAR, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the fastest growing (and shrinking) housing markets. The Boulder, Colorado area leads the nation with home prices rising 18.5% over the year. Home prices are down 13.1% in the Atlantic City-Hammonton, New Jersey region, the largest decline. \n \n Click here to see the 25 fastest growing housing markets. \n \n Click here to see the 25 fastest shrinking housing markets. \n \n In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Danielle Hale, managing director of housing research at the NAR, said, “It’s good to think of [real estate] as being a life cycle product.” Young people with relatively unestablished careers and unsettled families typically rent to remain mobile. Once they become more established, they tend to transition into homeownership. “And they don’t often transition back into renting,” Hale noted. \n \n Rising home prices are obviously a good thing for current owners, and also stimulate the economy. According to the “The State of the Nation’s Housing 2016,” a report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, when home equity grows, owners spend more on home improvement projects and consumer spending increases in households. \n \n One measure of the economy, the unemployment rate, appears to be tied to home prices. The percentage of the labor force looking for work fell over the year in June across the nation, particularly in growing housing markets. The jobless rate fell in all but one of the 25 fastest growing markets, while in nine of the 25 shrinking markets, the jobless rate actually increased. \n \n To encourage the economic effects of a healthy housing sector, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low. The resulting low mortgage rates have helped encourage home purchases and boosted housing prices. However, home prices have risen about twice as fast as incomes over the past 12 months. For this and many other reasons, Hale explained that, while additional equity is great news for homeowners, the rising prices (and stagnant wages) make purchasing a home far more challenging for potential buyers. \n \n The two largest hallmarks of fast-growing — and fast shrinking — markets are inventory levels and location, according to Hale. The NAR has tracked year-over-year inventory declines in each of the past 13 months. This means that there may be multiple offers on a single property, further driving up the original listing price. High demand, coupled with low new home construction rates, are the main drivers of the low inventory. \n \n Demand for homes in particular locations is also a major factor in home price increases. More than half of the 25 fastest growing housing markets are located either in California or Florida. Hale noted that favorable climate in California and the West has always drawn Americans looking to relocate. The enormous success of California’s tech industry has further enhanced the appeal. In Florida, she added, lifestyle factors can be even more important than labor market factors, especially for retirees. \n \n While California is home to some of the nation’s most expensive homes, Florida’s median home prices are fairly low even after nation-leading growths in a number of the state’s housing markets. \n \n To identify the 25 fastest growing (and 25 fastest shrinking) housing markets, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the largest and smallest home price changes over the 12 months through the second quarter of this year. Single-family home price data for the 180 metropolitan areas reviewed came from the NAR. Unemployment rates for metropolitan areas are for June 2016 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n \n These are the fastest growing (and shrinking) housing markets. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In his testimony last year before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he made the decision to document the interactions in a way that would not trigger security classification. \n \n GRASSLEY SAYS COMEY LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION \n \n But the newly released memos could cause problems for Comey. \n \n The Journal noted that Comey himself redacted classified elements in one of those memos, and another memo had material later upgraded by the FBI to “confidential” (a low classification level). \n \n They apparently were among the four memos Comey gave to friend Daniel Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School. \n \n In the seven total memos handed over to congressional committees, eight of the 15 pages have redactions under classified exceptions. They include classified information at one of the most sensitive levels -- SECRET -- as well as the lower level of confidential. \n \n In one memo documenting his January 2017 Trump Tower meeting, Comey wrote that the material should be classified at the SECRET level unless the intelligence agencies thought otherwise. \n \n “I am not sure of the proper classification here,” Comey writes, “so have chosen SECRET. Please let me know if it should be higher or lower than that.” \n \n This, too, could be at odds with Comey’s June 2017 Senate testimony that he avoided classified material in the memos so that they could be widely shared. \n \n The scrutiny of Comey comes as his former deputy McCabe faces potential legal complications from another IG probe that found he lied about a leak to The Wall Street Journal. The IG referred the findings to the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., to determine whether to seek charges. \n \n Comey has backed the IG’s findings and said Thursday that he \"could well be a witness\" in a criminal case against McCabe. \n \n McCabe attorney Michael Bromwich on Friday said McCabe is “upset and disappointed” about Comey's comments.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWhen James Comey gave four memos to a friend detailing his interactions with President Trump, he took pains to make sure they contained no classified information, the former FBI chief told Congress last year. However, the Justice Department is now investigating whether he was wrong about that, reports the Wall Street Journal. The department's inspector general is looking at two memos in particular. In one of them, Comey blacked out information of his own accord that he deemed to be confidential, according to the Journal. The other three he considered safe. One of those three, however, apparently contained information that was upgraded to classified status after Comey left the FBI. The situation is similar to one that occurred with Hillary Clinton and her infamous email server—some emails that she circulated were OK at the time she did so but were later upgraded to classified. No charges were brought against her (by Comey), and it's unclear whether Comey himself would face any charges in this new investigation. Fox News confirms that the inspector general is investigating the possible mishandling of classified info. One person who needs no convincing: President Trump. Comey \"leaked classified information,\" the president tweeted Thursday night, continuing a familiar theme of his. \"WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

(Associated Press) \n \n LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Attorneys for a Nebraska death row inmate whose case inspired the 1999 movie \"Boys Don't Cry\" say he should be ruled ineligible for execution because he has the intellect of a young child. \n \n John Lotter was sentenced to death for his role in the 1993 killings of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old transgender man, and two witnesses, Lisa Lambert and Philip DeVine, at a rural farmhouse in Humboldt, about 75 miles south of Omaha. Lotter has spent the last 22 years on death row. \n \n Lotter's lawyers filed a motion last week stating that recent IQ testing showed that the 46-year-old is intellectually disabled and therefore can't be put to death under a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling forbidding the execution of the intellectually disabled, the Lincoln Journal Star reported . \n \n Under Nebraska law, an IQ of 70 or below is presumptive evidence of an intellectual disability. Court records show that Lotter scored a 67 last year, which would be the equivalent IQ of an 8-year-old. \n \n Neuropsychologist Ricardo Weinstein determined that Lotter qualifies for an intellectual developmental disability diagnosis after reviewing trial and school records, and interviewing Lotter's mother, foster mother and a psychiatrist who worked with him as a child. Lotter scored an IQ of about 73 when he was 10 years old, according to Weinstein. \n \n Lotter's attorneys also cited a 2014 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that rejected a strict IQ cutoff rule in Florida. They said the court found a consensus among medical experts that IQ test scores shouldn't be read as a single number, but rather as a range that can fluctuate for many reasons. \n \n Richardson County District Judge Vicky Johnson will need to grant an evidentiary hearing in order to consider the issue. If granted, the state can seek its own experts. \n \n Lotter and another man, Marvin Thomas Nissen, raped Teena after finding out he was transgender and then killed him, Lambert and DeVine to silence the rape allegations, according to prosecutors. Nissen is serving life sentences for his role in the crimes. \n \n Teena's death is remembered as an important date in the history of U.S. transgender rights, and Hillary Swank's film portrayal of him won her an Oscar for best actress. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Lori Pilger daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever Lori Pilger posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAttorneys for a Nebraska death row inmate whose case inspired the 1999 movie Boys Don't Cry say he should be ruled ineligible for execution because he has the intellect of a young child.

Bidding will go on until June 12. \n \n Part of why this violin is so valuable is its provenance. The violin was made in 1731 by Antonio, who is considered to be the greatest violin maker ever. His 600 surviving violins are highly sought after by collectors, giving them multimillion-dollar price tags. \n \n The violin up for auction is known as the Kreutzer Stradivari, named for its first-known owner, Rodolphe Kreutzer. \n \n If you learned to play the violin, you can likely thank Kreutzer, a French violinist and teacher, who penned the 42 Études, a commonly used foundation for teaching students to play the instrument. \n \n Eventually, the violin came to be owned by Huguette Clark, a wealthy reclusive heiress. She received this pricey Stradivari from her parents, who were American royalty during the Gilded Age. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Heiress's multi-million dollar violin up for auction 1:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n \"There is a spectacular telegram that her parents sent her in Paris in 1920 that told her...when they were sailing and when they would be arriving in New York, and that her mother had just bought her, quote unquote, the most fabulous violin in the world,\" Keane said. \n \n The violin is one of more than 400 items from the family collection that Christie's is auctioning. It was found in Clark's closet after collecting dust for decades, according to Keane. \n \n This Stradivari is from his late period. \"What's important about his later works is that they're the ones that are consistently the most powerful for players tonally.

A rare viola made by the Italian artisan Antonio Stradivari in 1719 that will be sold by Sotheby's in a sealed bid auction in June is valued at $45 million. \n \n \"Kreutzer owned and played his namesake Stradivari from about 1795 until his death in 1831,\" Christie's said in a statement. \n \n The instrument was a present from her parents, copper magnate and politician William A. Clark and his wife Anna, to the then-teenaged Huguette. \n \n The violin will be sold in a special auction with bidding starting on June 6 and will coincide with the New York sale of more than 350 lots from the Clark estate on June 18. \n \n (Reporting by Patricia Reaney; Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman)\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nFunny what turns up in the closet of reclusive, deceased heiress: In this case, one of the world's most expensive musical instruments. Christie's has begun accepting sealed bids for a 1731 Stradivarius violin that had been in a closet of Huguette Clark for about 25 years, reports NBC News. The auction house estimates its worth to be $7.5 million to $10 million, which would be below the Stradivarius record of $16 million but still not too shabby for a longtime dust-collector, notes Reuters. This particular Stradivarius is so pricey in part because it was first owned by renowned concert violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, both stories explain. Clark's parents bought it in 1920, with her mom sending the teenaged Huguette a telegram from Paris to say she had just bought her \"the most fabulous violin in the world,\" says a Christie's musical expert. Analysis of the wood's ring growths confirms that the violin is legit. (Click to read about how Stradivari may not match up to modern violins.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

He says the plane returned to the gate and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment but didn't get back on the plane. \n \n Meanwhile, flight attendants killed the scorpion and checked overhead compartments for any additional unwanted arachnids. The flight then took off at 8:40 p.m., about an hour late. Members of Oregon State University's men's basketball team were on the flight, Cosgrove said. \n \n He says it's unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico. ||||| A plane carrying the Oregon State men's basketball team -- and, coincidentally, Oregonian/OregonLive reporter Tyson Alger -- from Los Angeles to Portland on Saturday had to return to the gate at LAX when a woman was stung by a scorpion. \n \n Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry-on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico. \n \n The Alaska Airlines flight landed at PDX about 11 p.m. after a 30-minute delay in Los Angeles. The University of Portland women's basketball team was on board as well. \n \n No word yet on the condition of the woman, who remained in California for medical treatment. But the fate of the scorpion is clear: someone stomped it. \n \n Earlier Saturday, the Beavers lost 68-55 to USC. \n \n So this is a new one \"We've been pushed back to the gate because a passenger was bit by something poisonous\" soooo can we all get off? -- Tyson Alger (@tysonalger) February 15, 2015 \n \n Scorpion is the bug de jour -- Tyson Alger (@tysonalger) February 15, 2015 \n \n Coach Tinkle was just two rows behind the woman that was stung.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIt was not Jeopardy‘s finest moment. \n \n During Wednesday night’s game, the categories were challenging and the answers were killer. By the time the dust settled, two of the three contestants had negative scores – a very rare occurrence for the long-running game show. \n \n Get push notifications with news, features and more. \n \n So for Final Jeopardy, only one contestant was able to compete: Kristin Sausville, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom and school volunteer from Delaware. \n \n “This was not one of our greatest days,” host Alex Trebek said dryly. “Kristin, I think you’re going to win.” \n \n Predictably, Twitter went crazy. \n \n “The vibe in the studio was shock,” Sausville tells PEOPLE. “I hadn’t realized that both of the other contestants were in the negative. My husband Justin was in the audience and later told me that there had been a lot of questions as to whether it had happened before.” \n \n As it turned out, it had happened before – including once to a player who ended up competing in the Tournament of Champions against Sausville’s husband. \n \n Yes, the Sausvilles are a husband and wife who have both won big on Jeopardy. We don’t recommend playing Trivial Pursuit at their dinner parties. \n \n When Sausville found herself alone on stage, the butterflies began. “It was more nerve-racking to be the only person on stage,” she says. “On the one hand, it was nice not to have to worry about what anyone else was wagering, but at the same time, it meant that all of the contestant coordinators, compliance people and stage crew were standing around me.” \n \n She didn’t respond to the final answer correctly, but it hardly mattered. She won $6,800 in the game and a two-day total of $31,601. ||||| Answer: This game show had only one contestant make it to the final round because two other competitors ended in the red. \n \n \n \n Question: What is the most bizarre episode of Jeopardy! ever? \n \n \n \n \n \n On Thursday night’s episode of Jeopardy!, Kristin Sausville, a mom of two from Delaware, made it to the final Jeopardy! round after her competition was in the negative figures by the end of Double Jeopardy. \n \n \n \n Sausville was forced to play alone and host Alex Trebek had some fun with her. He said, “Kristin, we’re going to start with you. You were in third place and the lead.” \n \n \n \n Even though she is a returning Jeopardy! champion, Sausville lost $1,600 during the final question, but upped her two day total to more than $31,000. She was a good sport about the whole situation and tweeted: \"Always sad when someone can't play Final. Even when I benefit. Seriously. #Jeopardy.\" \n \n Always sad when someone can't play Final.

During the game that aired last night, the \"categories were challenging and the answers were killer,\" People notes. So challenging that two of the three contestants ended up with negative scores by the end of Double Jeopardy, disqualifying them from the Final Jeopardy round. That left Delaware's Kristin Sausville to take on herself in the last part of the competition, allowing Trebek to charm the viewing audience with such witticisms as \"Kristin, I think you're going to win\" and \"Kristin, we're going to start with you. You were in third place, and in the lead.\" Sausville ended up not answering the final question correctly, but she did walk away with a two-day total of more than $31,000, Inside Edition notes. Oddly, the only other time this had happened on the show was to a player who once ended up playing against Sausville's husband, per People. Sausville took to Twitter to defend her utterly crushed competitors, posting: \"Always sad when someone can't play Final. Even when I benefit. Seriously.\" And to second that motion, this: \"To anyone snarking Stephanie and Brad: you had better ace the #JeopardyOnlineTest soon. Put up or shut up. It wasn't a good game for anyone.\" (Maybe ripe for a Will Ferrell parody, if he's not too busy playing baseball.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nEgyptian security officials say the health of ousted President Hosni Mubarak has deteriorated further, with doctors having to use a defibrillator twice and feed him liquids intravenously. \n \n The officials said Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were by his side at the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital south of Cairo where the 84-year-old former president is serving a life sentence. \n \n The officials, who are at Torah, did not say whether the defibrillator was used because Mubarak's heart stopped or to remedy irregular heartbeats. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. ||||| Former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak was in a coma Monday, a spokesman for Egypt's Interior Ministry said. \n \n \"Mubarak entered today into full coma. His two sons Gamal and Alaa submitted a request to the prison authority to move beside him and it has been accepted. His health has been deteriorating since the verdict, with high blood pressure, problems breathing, and irregular heart beat,\" Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said. \n \n Mubarak's lawyer has submitted a request that he be moved from prison to a private hospital, Mahmoud said. \n \n Mubarak, 84, is in a Cairo prison hospital after being sentenced to life in prison for the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators last year. Mubarak was already suffering from health problems and attended court on a gurney.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nHosni Mubarak's life sentence is growing ever shorter. The former president has gone from slipping in and out of consciousness to \"full coma,\" according to a rep for Egypt's Interior Ministry, and security officials say doctors have twice used a defibrillator on him. It's unclear whether it was used because his heart stopped or to remedy irregular heartbeats, which he continues to have problems with, reports the AP. \"His two sons Gamal and Alaa submitted a request to the prison authority to move beside him and it has been accepted,\" says the rep; they're currently by his side in the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital. Mubarak's lawyers continue their efforts to get him moved from that location to a private hospital, reports CNN. The AP yesterday reported that his wife and two daughters-in-law were granted special permission to visit him in order to squash rumors of his death.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Pearce Tefft of Fargo, ND, posted the open letter on INFORUM Monday, writing that his son Peter’s values are not shared by his family. “I, along with all of his siblings and his entire family, wish to loudly repudiate my son’s vile, hateful, and racist rhetoric and actions,” he wrote. “We do not know specifically where he learned these beliefs. He did not learn them at home.” Peter was first identified by Twitter user Yes, You’re Racist in a grainy screengrab from a video taken during the rally, but he's also been interviewed by news outlets about his beliefs. Pearce said that Peter’s family members originally stayed silent about Peter’s white nationalist beliefs, but ultimately realized that was a mistake. “It was the silence of good people that allowed the Nazis to flourish the first time around, and it is the silence of good people that is allowing them to flourish now,” Pearce writes, adding that unless his son renounces his “hateful beliefs,” he “is not welcome at our family gatherings any longer.” Peter Tefft's nephew also denounced Peter in a statement to WDAY: “He scares us all, we don’t feel safe around him, and we don’t know how he came to be this way.” Pearce ended his letter with a powerful response to a joke his son made about putting anti-fascists in ovens, writing: “Peter, you will have to shovel our bodies into the oven, too. Please son, renounce the hate, accept and love all.”\n#END SUMMARY"}

laband syndrome, rutherford, and ramon syndromes . since exact \n etiology and pathogenesis of hgf has not been yet established, therefore, there is a need for further research regarding genetic inheritance of hgf . \n attempts should also be made to find out various preventive measures and implementation of different treatment modalities to limit or eradicate hgf and associated complications such as esthetics, speech and functional problems as much as possible . \n a 14-year - old male [ figure 1 ], accompanied by his parents, reported with the complaint of swollen gums, presented with gradual and progressive gingival enlargement of both jaws from the age of 7 years [ figure 2a  c ] . \n the enlargement had led to incompetent lips, poor esthetics and also hindered speech and mastication . \n intra - oral examination revealed fibrotic enlargement of gingiva involving both upper and lower arches . \n his current health condition and mental state were considered normal . during the evaluation of his family history, the patient 's mother demonstrated similar intra - oral features in the form of gingival enlargement, involving to various extents, the maxilla as well as the mandible with no syndromic association [ figure 3 ] . \n biopsy sample was taken and sent for histopathological examination showing stratified squamous epithelium with long slender rete pegs, connective tissue and dense collagen stroma [ figure 4 ] . \n on the basis of the histopathological findings and positive family history the diagnosis of  hgf  was made with no syndromic association . in the treatment enlarged, gingival overgrowth was surgically removed [ figure 5a and b ] ( gingivectomy ) and patient was referred to department of orthodontics and dento - facial orthopedics for correction of malocclusion . \n ( c ) preoperative facial view left side intraoral view of mother histopathological specimen showing stratified squamous epithelium with long slender rete pegs, connective tissue and dense collagen stroma ( a ) peroperative view of mandibular jaw . \n ( b ) peroperative view of maxillary jaw postoperative healing was good and desired crown lengthening was achieved . \n patient 's speech and masticatory problems were completely resolved with gain of adequate functional ability . \n esthetics was significantly improved in terms of gingival appearance after surgical excision of hypertrophied gingival tissue . \n patient was put in the follow - up program at 1, 3, 6 months interval followed by after 1 and 2 years . \n there was no recurrence of the disease even after 2 years follow - up [ figure 6a  c ] . \n syndromes that have been occasionally associated with hgf are zimmerman -

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA unanimous Supreme Court ruling has invalidated an Arkansas state prison rule that barred inmates from growing beards measuring more than a quarter of an inch long. The rule had been challenged by inmate Gregory Holt, a Muslim man who had asked for permission to grow a half-inch-long beard as a compromise from the full beard he believes is required by his faith. In a ruling announced Tuesday, the Supreme Court said the policy violated Holt's religious beliefs. \n \n Arkansas was virtually alone in having such a restrictive rule on beards. Holt — who is also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad — had argued in a handwritten plea to the court that the state's refusal to grant exceptions was oppressive and forced inmates \"to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand, or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce\" to the grooming policy. The Supreme Court had earlier granted Holt's request to maintain a half-inch long beard while his case worked its way through the appeals process. Holt, who did time for making a threat against President Bush's daughters before being convicted in 2010 of knifing his girlfriend, was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. \n \n The opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, said the state has a legitimate need to prevent the concealment of contraband, which was its stated reason for the policy. But, Alito said, \"the argument that this interest would be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to grow a 1⁄2-inch beard is hard to take seriously.\" \n \n \"An item of contraband would have to be very small indeed to be concealed by a 1⁄2-inch beard, and a prisoner seeking to hide an item in such a short beard would have to find a way to prevent the item from falling out. Since the Department does not demand that inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is hard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband in a 1⁄2-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his head,\" Alito said. \n \n Gregory Houston Holt, an Arkansas prisoner who says he should be allowed to keep a beard on religious grounds.

The state's rule specified that beard length must be kept to a quarter inch; Gregory Holt, a Muslim man also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, had sought permission to grow the slightly longer beard in a compromise: He believes his faith demands a full beard, but was willing to accept the half-inch length in keeping with what California prison policy afford Muslim inmates there. In what NBC News terms a \"handwritten plea,\" he noted that Arkansas' restriction put inmates in a catch-22: grow the full beard he sees as required by his religion and be disciplined, or give in and violate his faith. Arkansas argued that contraband smuggling would become a concern with the longer beard. Wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the opinion, that \"argument ... is hard to take seriously. An item of contraband would have to be very small indeed to be concealed by\" such a beard, and the inmate would have to devise a way to keep the item in there to boot. Further, \"Since the Department does not demand that inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is hard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband in a half-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his head.\" The AP notes that more than 40 states allow inmates to keep beards, and NBC frames Arkansas as \"virtually alone in having such a restrictive rule.\" Holt has previously served time for threatening President Bush's daughters; he's now serving a life sentence for a brutal assault on his girlfriend.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nit is characterized by the proliferation of dendritic cells, which express cd1a and s-100 protein but lack langerin expression and birbeck granules . \n we report a patient with skin idct associated with a mosquito bite that showed spontaneous regression after 17 months of follow - up . \n literature review reveals this to be the first case of idct associated with a mosquito bite . \n a 28-year - old man presented with an 8-month history of multiple cutaneous plaques and nodules without systemic symptoms . \n he gave a history of a mosquito bite on his back after which a nodule developed at bite site after 4 weeks . \n dermatological examination revealed multiple skin - colored plaques and nodules measuring approximately 0.5 to 1.8  cm in diameter over the body ( figure 1 ) . \n . a clinical diagnosis of cutaneous elastic fibers rhabdomyolysis was made and a biopsy of skin lesion was taken . \n histopathologically, the dermis was effaced by round or polygonal cells with oval nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . \n immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells were positive for cd68, cd1a, and s-100, but negative for langerin, cd3, cd20, cd21, cd23, cd35, cd163, cd123, hmb45, myeloperoxidase, and factor xiiia . the proliferation index ( ki-67 ) was about 30% . \n this patient was diagnosed as having primary idct based on the histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features . \n the patient was alive with spontaneous disease regression after 17 months of follow - up . \n histology shows the dermis was effaced by round or polygonal cells with oval nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm ( hematoxylin and eosin staining ;

This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAccess Denied \n \n This page can only be viewed by subscribers. \n \n 1.

Most members stick to the ideological positions they've staked out for most of their careers, with Sherrod Brown, John Kerry, and Chris Dodd among the most liberal senators and Jim Inhofe atop the conservative rankings. The House list looks similarly familiar. The rankings also show how thoroughly the 2008 elections wiped out moderate Republicans. Of the \"10 in the middle\" centrist category, all 20—from the House and Senate—are Democrats, with the exception of Joe Lieberman. The Connecticut independent summed up the situation with an awkward sound bite: \"With every passing year, the hyperpartisanship has been getting more hyper.\" Click here to check out the rankings.\n#END SUMMARY"}

The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA 20-year-old Saudi student who was arrested in Lubbock, Tex., late Wednesday was close to constructing a bomb and had researched possible targets, including the Dallas home of former president George W. Bush and the residences of three Americans who served at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, authorities said. \n \n Khalid Aldawsari made his first appearance in federal court Friday morning in Lubbock and said he understood the charges against him. U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy M. Koenig set a detention hearing for March 11 and ordered him held in custody until then. \n \n Aldawsari retained criminal defense attorney Rod Hobson, who issued a statement saying that \"the eyes of the world are on this case and the treatment of this accused person,\" the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported. \"This is a wonderful opportunity for us to show the world how truly fair our legal system is, even to those who are accused of trying to harm our country,\" he said. \n \n The defendant came to the United States as a student in September 2008, but his plan all along was to kill Americans, according to journal entries cited in an FBI affidavit. As a Saudi who entered the United States legally on a student visa, he evoked memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudis. \n \n Aldawsari's attempts to purchase a chemical used in explosives quickly prompted calls to police from American companies, conduct that law enforcement officials praised. \n \n Unlike in a number of recent arrests of suspected terrorism plotters, however, authorities said that Aldawsari had managed to advance his plans and assemble some of the ingredients for a bomb before the FBI became aware of him. \"He was meticulous and a serious threat,\" said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. \n \n Officials said that Aldawsari appeared to be acting alone and was not in touch with any terrorist organization overseas. But his journal entries stated that he was inspired by Osama bin Laden and wanted to create \"an Islamic group under the banner\" of al-Qaeda, according to the affidavit. \n \n In an e-mail cited in the affidavit, Aldawsari wrote that \"one operation in the land of the infidels is equal to ten operations against occupying forces in the land of the Muslims.\" \n \n Aldawsari first studied English as a second language at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He entered Texas Tech University in August 2009 to study chemical engineering, then transferred to business studies at South Plains College in Lubbock last month. \n \n Aldawsari, whose education was funded by a Saudi corporation, wrote that he worked hard to excel in high school so he could get a scholarship to study in the United States. He refers to the Saudi royal family as the \"Saululi\" government, a derisive term, and called the Saudi king the \"Traitor of the Two Holy Places,\" according to the FBI affidavit. \n \n \"And now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives, and continuous planning to target the infidel American, it is time for Jihad,\" Aldawsari wrote in his journal, the affidavit said. \n \n A Saudi official said Aldawsari had drawn no attention before his arrest. ||||| terrorble Terror Suspect Wanted to Make Bombs Out of Baby Dolls \n \n Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, the 20-year-old Saudi arrested in Texas yesterday on terror charges, had a lot of ideas. In addition to blowing up the Crawford home of George W. Bush and bringing a backpack bomb into a Dallas nightclub, Aldawsari allegedly hoped to wreak havoc in New York City with car bombs placed in highly trafficked areas and, à la The Rock, baby dolls rigged to explode: \n \n \n \n \n \n A bloodthirsty Saudi Arabian college student was busted in Texas for a sickening plot to pack baby dolls with explosives, put them in strollers and set them off at the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building and on Wall Street, police sources told The Post yesterday.... \n \n Aldawsari's [sic] obsessively pored through online pictures of realistic-looking baby dolls, including some that could be altered to conceal bomb equipment, according to the complaint. \n \n He also looked at sites related to strollers, baby clothes and diapers.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe FBI has detailed information about Khalid Aldawsari’s alleged terrorist ambitions—because the 20-year-old wrote all about them in his journal and emails to himself. Aldawsari wasn’t affiliated with any terrorist group, and Saudi Arabian officials confirm that he had no criminal record back home. But he was inspired by Osama bin Laden, and wrote that he wanted to create “an Islamic group under the banner” of al-Qaeda, the Washington Post reports. He decided to study in the US specifically to kill Americans. “One operation in the land of the infidels is equal to ten … in the land of the Muslims,” he wrote. He first studied English at Vanderbilt, then chemical engineering at Texas Tech, before transferring to South Plains College. “Now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives, and continuous planning to target the infidel American, it is time for Jihad,” he wrote. Another journal entry outlined a \"synopsis of important steps\" of his plan: to rent cars with various fake IDs and plant remote-detonating bombs in them, leaving them in cities during rush hour.

It gave no further details about the case. \n \n U.S. officials named the suspect on Saturday as Deyun Shi and said he was suspected of having killed two of his teenage nephews, aged 14 and 15, at a home in Arcadia, a city in Los Angeles county. They believed he had fled to China. \n \n Shi, who U.S. police consider \"armed and dangerous\", is also suspected of attacking his wife, U.S. authorities have said. \n \n Hong Kong has an extradition agreement with U.S. authorities that has allowed the transfer of a number of fugitives back to the United States over the years. \n \n \"Hong Kong Police will continue to take strong enforcement action against overseas fugitives fleeing to Hong Kong,\" Sunday's police statement said, with the man having been apprehended in Tung Chung where the city's airport is located. \n \n A Los Angeles police department official earlier told Reuters it believed Shi was trying to get to Beijing and may have been trying to transit through Hong Kong when he was caught. \n \n Unlike Hong Kong, China does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. \n \n (Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Gareth Jones) ||||| \n \n Barry Greenhalgh, an Encino attorney who said he had been contacted by a partner of Shi's to arrange legal assistance for Shi, said he was \"interested in looking into\" whether the absence of the death penalty in Hong Kong could be a basis for stopping or delaying extradition. \n \n \n \n When Shi and his family moved to Southern California is unclear. \n \n \n \n Greenhalgh said Shi and his wife had two sons, and they had come to the United States about a year ago. Property records indicate that in August 2014, the couple bought a three-bedroom, mid-century ranch home on Briargate Lane in Arcadia for $1.08 million. In May 2015 they purchased a five-bedroom Mediterranean-style home in La Cañada Flintridge for $2.67 million. \n \n \n \n The California Secretary of State's business registration database indicates a person named Deyun Shi registered a business in California in November 2014 called Xunding World Information Integrated Group. The business' address is given as 5079 Walnut Grove Ave. in San Gabriel. \n \n \n \n What kind of business Xunding World Information Integrated Group conducted is unclear, though customs records in China indicate that the company imported various goods from China, including lamps, books and a large quantity of \"light oil painting tripods.\" \n \n \n \n Before coming to the U.S., Shi and his wife had multiple businesses in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, a metropolis of 18 million people only a subway ride from Hong Kong. Among the companies they were involved with were Shenzhen Kejing Electrical Co. and Shenzhen Xunding Technology Co., Chinese business registration records show. \n \n \n \n Reports in the Chinese media indicate that Shi and those businesses figured in numerous bribery cases investigated by the local branches of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, or CCDI, a key body within the Chinese Communist Party that probes corruption and other wrongdoing allegations among party cadres. \n \n \n \n Shi appears to have been a central figure in at least four bribery cases in Shenzhen, according to numerous reports in Chinese media. Two local officials in Shenzhen who were in charge of government procurement, Li Zihua and Song Yixiang, were sentenced in November 2014 to 10 years in prison for accepting bribes from Shi, multiple reports in the Chinese media say.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPolice in Hong Kong on Sunday arrested a Chinese national suspected of killing his two teenage nephews at their Southern California home on Friday and then fleeing to Beijing. US authorities also believe Deyun Shi, 44, attempted to kill his wife, Reuters reports. Police say Shi learned Thursday that his wife planned to divorce him, the Los Angeles Times reports. That night, Shi returned to the family home in La Cañada Flintridge, which he had moved out of, and attacked his wife with a woodcutting tool. He left after his son, 15, stepped in. Police think he later drove to the Arcadia home where his nephews lived, per the Times. The boys had been left sleeping while their parents visited Shi's wife at the hospital. Later, the mother discovered one of the boys bleeding and unresponsive. Both boys suffered blunt-force trauma and were pronounced dead at the scene. While Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the US, the Times reports, the proceedings could be complicated if Shi will face the death penalty, which Hong Kong does not have. \"Any possibility of execution will be a reason for Hong Kong not to surrender,\" one expert tells the Times. A US lawyer providing legal assistance to Shi says he's \"interested in looking into\" using that to delay or stop extradition. Before moving to the US about a year ago, Shi, who appears to have run an importing business here, had several businesses in Shenzhen, China, the Times reports, citing Chinese media reports that say Shi was a \"central figure\" in at least four bribery cases that ended with three officials going to prison. It is unclear, the Times reports, if Chinese authorities are interested in having Shi sent back to them.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAn Alabama grad student reached his goal of mowing 50 yards in 50 states. \n \n Rodney Smith Jr. cut the last yard of his journey Tuesday in Hawaii. He spent two months on the road mowing lawns for those in need for free. \n \n Advertisement \n \n He stopped in Jackson in June, where he cut five lawns with the help of some Forest Hill High School football players. His mission started May 17 with a lawn mower, a weed trimmer and a blower with the hopes of changing lives. \n \n He ended the mission with more than 200 children signed up to join the 50 yard challenge in their cities. \n \n Now Smith is raising the bar. Beginning May 6, he will launch 7 continents, 7 lawns. \n \n “It’s similar to 50 states, 50 lawns, but this time, I’m mowing lawns on each of the seven continents: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and Antarctica (shoveling snow),” Smith said on Facebook. “The reason I’m doing this is because the free lawn care service we (Raising Men Lawn Care Service) provide to the elderly, disabled, single moms and veterans isn’t just a service needed here in America, it is also needed worldwide.” \n \n Smith said he hopes to encourage more young people around the world to take on the 50-yard challenge and make “a difference one lawn at a time.” \n \n AlertMe ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rodney Smith Jr is hoping to make the country happier, one garden at a time \n \n A Bermudian man has mowed his way through all 50 US states, cutting lawns for veterans, single mothers, the elderly and disabled people. \n \n Rodney Smith Jr, who lives in Huntsville, Alabama, set off across the country in May and ended his epic journey on 17 July. \n \n His group, Raising Men Lawn Care Service, aims to encourage children to take part in community service. \n \n This is the second year Mr Smith has done the challenge. \n \n On his website, Mr Smith pledged to mow \"2-3 lawns per state\" ahead of his journey, anywhere within a 30-mile radius of a major city in the state. \n \n A section on the site allowed people to \"submit a lawn\" for Mr Smith to mow. \n \n Starting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Mr Smith drove through all 48 contiguous states in the US mowing lawns. \n \n He then flew to Alaska and finally on to Hawaii, where he completed his mission. \n \n Posting about his travels on Twitter and Facebook, he said he was \"making a difference one lawn at a time\". \n \n On top of his personal mission, Mr Smith also leads the 50 Yard Challenge - a call for children across the country to mow 50 lawns in their area. \n \n Participants get a free mower once they complete the challenge, the Raising Men Lawn Care Service website says. \n \n But after travelling across the US for the second year in a row, Mr Smith is now seeking a new challenge. \n \n \"My goal for 2019 has been set,\" he wrote online. \"7 Continents 7 Lawns.\" ||||| Alabama man stop in Kansas on his way to mow 50 lawns in 50 states \n \n Rodney Smith Jr., a 29-year-old man from Alabama, has founded an organization called Raising Men Lawn Care Service. His calling this summer is to mow 50 lawns in 50 states for people in need of help including the elderly, disabled, and veterans.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nRodney Smith Jr. has visited all 50 US states twice, but you'll have to forgive him if he doesn't recall any as particularly distinctive. There was little time for sightseeing as Smith spent much of his time mowing lawns voluntarily. The 29-year-old founder of Raising Men Lawn Care Service in Huntsville, Ala., which encourages kids to get involved in community service, set out on his second round-the-country trip in May, pledging to mow two to three lawns for strangers in need in each state, provided they were within a 30-mile radius of a major city. Starting in Milwaukee, Wis., he drove around the 48 continuous states, assisting a Korean War veteran in Minneapolis, Minn., and an amputee in Casper, Wy. He then flew to Alaska and on to Hawaii. It was there, after mowing the lawn of a stage 4 cancer patient, that he completed his mission Tuesday, per the BBC. Smith celebrated by announcing that more than 200 kids across the US have accepted his call to mow 50 lawns for community members free of charge. Children who complete the 50 Yard Challenge will receive a free mower, according to Smith's website. Smith, however, is setting higher goals. For 2019, he plans to mow seven lawns in seven continents, though he admits he might have to settle for shoveling snow in Antarctica. \"The free lawn care service we … provide to the elderly, disabled, single moms and veterans isn't just a service needed here in America, it is also needed worldwide,\" he writes on Facebook, per WAPT. \"I'm just doing what God wants me to do, and I encourage people to get out there and do the same,\" Smith adds, per the Wichita Eagle. \"And it doesn't have to be with a lawn mower. There's many ways to make a difference.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Romig called 911 on Jan. 30 at 2 a.m. saying that an \"unknown white male\" busted down their Dunnellon home front door and shot his 63-year-old girlfriend Sally Kaufman-Ruff in the head, according to the arrest report. \n \n When deputies with the Marion County Sheriff's Office arrived, they said Romig pointed out a crowbar near the front door and a partially smoked cigarette on the front porch, that he said he had never seen before. \n \n Kaufman-Ruff was found in the master bedroom laying in bed with a fatal gunshot wound to the head. Detectives said it appears she was likely shot from several inches away. Romig said he awoke to a man with a headlamp on standing above him and when he struggled with the intruder his girlfriend was accidentally shot, according to the report. \n \n A piece of fabric was collected from the front door. Romig said he thought it was torn from the intruder's jacket, according to the report. \n \n Romig said he and Kaufman-Ruff had been living together for more than two years. He also said he is the sole beneficiary on her will, that excluded her only daughter, deputies said in the report. \n \n On the way home from the hospital later on Jan. 30, Romig sent two text messages that he said were meant for his wife to one of the investigating detectives. \n \n \"I think they are going to arrest mw [sic],\" one read. \n \n Romig said he sent them accidentally, because he was nervous, according to the report. \n \n Romig's account quickly unraveled when investigators determined that his DNA was found on the cigarette, the door and that the piece of fabric was clearly cut with scissors to make it look like there was a break-in. \n \n Romig later texted his wife that he \"had a very bad night\" and that his girlfriend was shot, but \"things don't add up.\" \n \n \"I'm afraid I did something I don't remember,\" Romig said in a text. \n \n The suspect later admitted to detectives that he has been suffering from black-outs, having \"out-of-body experiences\" and that he was hearing voices, according to the report. Romig said he knew he was experiencing a black-out on the night Kaufman-Ruff was killed when he woke up in the kitchen with all the lights on in the house and saw the victim laying in bed with a gunshot wound to the head, detectives said. \n \n Romig admitted to detectives that he staged the crime scene to look like a home invasion, then called 911. \n \n Romig is charged with premeditated murder, making a false report to law enforcement and tampering with evidence. He is held without bail at the Marion County Jail. \n \n Copyright 2018 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAfter a Florida woman was shot dead on Jan. 30, her live-in boyfriend told police she was the victim of a home-invasion gone awry. Then, Marion County sheriff's officials say, David Romig twice texted his wife to say he feared he was going to be arrested for Sally Kaufmann-Ruff's death—or, he meant to text his wife. Instead, he texted Detective Damon Baxley, who had interviewed Romig after the incident. The Ocala Star-Banner reports authorities were called to the Dunnellon home just after 2am and found Kaufmann-Ruff, 64, had suffered a gunshot to the head. Romig, 52, described being awoken by a man wearing a head lamp and brandishing a revolver. Romig alleged the intruder had pried the front door open and fled after a struggle, leaving behind potential evidence: an L&M brand cigarette—not one Romig said he or his girlfriend used—and a piece of torn cloth on the door frame. Except an analysis showed Romig's DNA was on the cigarette and cloth, whose straight edges suggested it was cut with scissors, rather than torn. And then there were the texts: \"I think they are going to arrest mw [sic],\" read one, and \"Think they are going to arrest.\" Romig allegedly told police they were intended for his wife, and he did successfully text her the following, per officials: \"I am afraid I did something I don’t remember. ... If I did this I will kill myself.\" A release from the sheriff's office says Romig \"staged the scene ... after he had shot Kaufmann-Ruff during an 'out-of-body' experience.\" Detectives say he acknowledged Kaufmann-Ruff's daughter is excluded from her will, which benefits only him, reports Click Orlando. He has been charged with second-degree murder and will next appear in court March 20.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It also hinted at a romantic relationship between his two alleged killers -- 32-year-old Danelle Geier and 39-year-old George Ishler Jr. -- whom police say are related as niece and uncle. \n \n Grier on Wednesday waived her preliminary hearing on the charges against her. The testimony came during a preliminary hearing for Ishler. When it ended, counts of murder and related offenses were bound over for trial in county court. \n \n The lead investigator in the case, state Trooper Brian Wakefield, said Geier and Ishler killed Bettig because they thought they stood to inherit money from him. They had tried and failed to drown him on a trip the trio took to Rehoboth Beach in Delaware on Aug. 10. \n \n \"When they were in Delaware, [Ishler] stated that he did dunk Bettig while in the ocean, but that he felt he couldn't do it [hold him under] and didn't continue,\" Wakefield said. \n \n Wakefield added: \"[Ishler] stated he was to dunk Bettig and Danelle was to wrap her legs around him to hold Bettig down under water.\" \n \n According to the trooper, the trio returned to the State College area on Aug. 12, and went directly to the Blackhawk Quarry in Potter Township, luring Bettig with the promise of a marijuana harvest. It was there that Wakefield said Bettig was pushed from an 80-foot ledge. Police believe Ishler pushed him, while Geier waited in the car with her toddler son. \n \n It took five days for Bettig's body to be discovered. But Wakefield said a pathologist believes he may have remained alive for up to two days, immobile and possibly unconscious. A medical examiner has ruled the cause of death \"blunt force trauma due to a fall.\" \n \n Wakefield said Bettig was likely still alive then when Geier and Ishler returned to the scene eight hours later to plant Bettig's belongings and vehicle there. They had hoped to make it look as though Bettig had been there on his own and accidentally fallen, Wakefield added. \n \n Police say investigators first found the professor's car at the quarry days after he and the vehicle were first reported missing. His body was found soon after, with buzzards hovering above it. \n \n Police say it was Geier and Ishler who filed the missing persons report days after their return from Delaware. \n \n According to Wakefield, they went from concerned friends to prime suspects after someone reported seeing a woman matching Geier's description at the quarry on that date. \n \n Geier and Ishler were arrested and charged. Police say they confessed in conversations with law enforcement. \n \n In an informal conversation with a trooper after his arrest, Ishler claimed that while he had carried out the murder, Geier was the driving force, Wakefield said. Wakefield said Ishler told the female trooper that Geier's sway over him derived from the \"power of [a female private part].\" \n \n Bettig had befriended Geier and Ishler months before his death, and she had moved into his home in Lemont with her child at the beginning of the year. Since then, there have been conflicting reports of Bettig's romantic involvement with Geier, and Ishler's romantic involvement with her. \n \n More consistent are the reports of an increasingly fraught relationship among the three of them in the days and weeks leading up to his death. \n \n On Wednesday, Wakefield said Geier told him that she and Ishler had grown to resent the professor's sharp tongue and criticisms of them and Geier's child-rearing habits. \n \n \"She said she was upset because Bettig criticized the way she raised her child and was belittling Ishler, saying there were many things she had had enough of.\" \n \n But while it may have been personal for Geier, police say Ishler told them that he sought to claim an inheritance from the media studies professor. He said Bettig had recently updated his will to include them. \n \n Wakefield said officials found such a handwritten document in Ishler's home. But the trooper said it's not clear if Bettig's signature on the item is valid, while the rest of the note was admittedly penned by Ishler. \n \n Ishler's defense questioned the proof behind such claims in Wednesday's hearing, saying the investigation of this case is far from finished. \n \n They also argued that some law enforcement claims against their client, or about the things he's alleged to have said while in their presence, lack documentation. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The lead investigator on the case testified that a pathologist believes the 56-year-old professor died slowly and was probably immobilized by the fall, PennLive reports. State Trooper Brian Wakefield was testifying at the preliminary hearing of 39-year-old George Ishler Jr., who is accused of pushing Bettig into the quarry on Aug. 12. Wakefield said Bettig was probably still alive eight hours later, when Ishler and alleged accomplice Danelle Geier, 32, returned to plant his possessions and vehicle at the scene to make it look like an accident. His body was found Aug. 17, with buzzards circling over it. Wakefield testified that Bettig had been romantically involved with Geier, who had moved into his home along with her infant son, reports the Centre Daily Times. But there was tension between Bettig, Geier, and Ishler, who was described as a friend of Bettig who was also romantically involved with Geier—despite being her uncle. Wakefield testified Geier told him that in the weeks leading up to the killing \"she was upset because the professor criticized the way she raised her child and was belittling Ishler.\" He testified that Ishler told police the killing was to claim an inheritance from the professor and that on Aug. 10, they had planned to drown him during a beach visit and make it look like an accident but found that they couldn't go through with it.\n#END SUMMARY"}

'Gossip Girl' star's rep calls naked pics '100 percent fake' \n \n Peter Kramer/AP Blake Lively isn't the naked woman in nude pictures posted online Tuesday, her rep said. \n \n It was one checkmark on the young Hollywood starlet claim-to-fame list that Blake Lively had yet to earn – possibly until now. \n \n \n \n The \"Gossip Girl\" star, 23, is purportedly the naked woman in several full-frontal photos posted online Tuesday. \n \n \n \n In the five images, a blond woman who looks remarkably like the leggy Lively can be seen holding an iPhone as she takes pictures of herself while naked and standing in front of a mirror. \n \n BLAKE LIVELY PHOTOS - CLICK HERE \n \n \n \n Just one of the photos shows the entirety of the mystery girl's face, with the phone blocking nearly all of her eyes, nose and mouth in the other four. \n \n \n \n A rep for the blond bombshell, however, has strongly denied claims that the pictures are authentic. \n \n \n \n \"The photos of Blake Lively which have just surfaced on various websites including Perez Hilton and Zap2it.com are 100 percent FAKE,\" her publicist told the Daily News in a statement. \"Blake has never taken nude photos of herself.\" \n \n \n \n \"Blake will pursue legal action against the publication which initially published these photographs and any other outlets that republish them in any manner,\" the rep added. \n \n \n \n But the actress' rep has yet to address another set of photos: the series of images showing Lively holding hands with new beau Leonardo DiCaprio. \n \n \n \n DiCaprio and Lively made choreographed exits from a French hotel on Friday. (INFphoto.com) \n \n \n \n The snapshots, reportedly taken in Monte Carlo on Friday, are the biggest sign yet that Lively is dating the 36-year-old screen star despite previous dismissals of such speculation. \n \n \n \n The pair has slowly and subtly increased their PDA, from a reported business dinner last fall to what appeared to be a happy hug on a yacht in Cannes several weeks ago. \n \n \n \n Their joint vacation has since taken them to the French city of Saint-Paul as well as Portofino, Italy. \n \n \n \n It's unknown where they'll pop up next, but it's a safe bet Lively will have her clothes on. ||||| More 'Blake Lively' Nude Photos Leaked \n \n More 'Blake Lively' Nude Photos Leaked \n \n The hacker who claims to have naked pictures ofhas just upped the ante, scoffing at claims the pics are photoshopped ... and he's posted more pictures to prove his case.The hacker just posted 17 additional pics.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nFILE - This undated file photo provided by the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail shows James Alex Fields Jr. A man in custody at a Virginia jail assaulted fellow inmate Fields, the man accused of...

(Associated Press) \n \n CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — A man in custody at a Virginia jail assaulted fellow inmate James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of driving a car into counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally, the facility's superintendent said Friday. \n \n Fields was being seen by jail staff in an office Monday morning when Timothy Ray Brown Jr. made his way past a correctional officer and hit Fields \"twice on the left side of his body above his shoulders,\" Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, said in a news release. \n \n \"At no time did Inmate Fields have an opportunity to defend himself or respond in any manner,\" the news release said. \n \n A friend of Brown's told The Associated Press on Friday that Brown was a friend of Heather Heyer, the woman killed in the Aug. 12, 2017, attack, which left dozens more injured. \n \n Fields — who has been described by authorities and others who knew him as an admirer of Adolf Hitler — faces first-degree murder and other charges in Heyer's death. \n \n Both Fields and Brown were evaluated after the incident and neither had serious injuries, Kumer said. \n \n Brown has been charged with assault and Fields has been given the chance to pursue criminal charges, according to the news release. \n \n Fields' attorney didn't respond to requests for comment. \n \n Jay Scott, a friend of Brown's who said he was with him and Heyer in downtown Charlottesville when the car plowed into the crowd, learned of the jail fight and started a GoFundMe page this week to raise money for an attorney. \n \n \"He shouldn't have to fight it alone,\" said Scott. \n \n The August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Hundreds more came out to protest against the white nationalists. \n \n Prosecutors allege that after the crowd broke up, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially diverse group of people had gathered to protest the rally. They say he rapidly accelerated his gray Dodge Challenger into the crowd. The car then reversed and fled. \n \n Fields was arrested a relatively short while after the attack. Kumer told AP he was not aware of any other assaults or threats against Fields during his time in custody. \n \n Fields, of Maumee, Ohio, is scheduled to go on trial next month on the state charges he faces.

(Associated Press) \n \n In this May 13, 2014 photo, Saira Blair, a 17-year-old student at Hedgesville High School, waves to motorists along Route 9 in Hedgesville, W. Va. After Tuesday’s GOP primary, the 17-year-old is one election... (Associated Press) \n \n CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A week before her high school graduation, Saira Blair was barely old enough to vote when she unseated a West Virginia lawmaker almost four times her age. \n \n After Tuesday's GOP primary, the 17-year-old is one election away from becoming the youngest state lawmaker in West Virginia history. Larry Swan, sworn in as a 20-year-old delegate in 1972, set the current record. \n \n Blair's birthday is in July, so she would just meet the 18-year-old minimum age for West Virginia House of Delegates members. Seventeen-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election can vote in West Virginia's primary. \n \n Soft-spoken and on-message, Blair is a churchgoer who says she is pro-life, pro-family, pro-gun rights and pro-business. She can rattle off a laundry list of businesses taxes she wants abolished or lowered. \n \n \"People saw that you don't need to wait until you are 40, 50 or 60 to realize our conservative principles are beneficial to everyone,\" the Martinsburg teen said of her primary win. \n \n Blair also has family experience on her side. Her electrician father, Craig Blair, is a state senator who once held the House seat she is seeking. \n \n The teenager has more on her mind than stump speeches. She graduates from Hedgesville High School next Wednesday. Then she'll head to West Virginia University in the fall to pursue economics and Spanish degrees. She says finance is her field of choice. \n \n Blair will skip spring classes if she clinches the Eastern Panhandle seat, since lawmakers convene for business in Charleston from January to March. The two-year House gig pays a $20,000 annual salary, plus per diem. \n \n Only about 150 votes separated Blair from Republican Del. Larry Kump in the Eastern Panhandle primary, according to unofficial results. But midterm turnout was dismal: Only about 1,600 votes were cast in the 59th House District. \n \n Friends in her high school class of 400 helped wave signs at polling places. She rallied some to register to vote. Blair also spent $4,900 and had a $2,300 loan, compared to Kump's $1,840 in spending. \n \n \"Quite frankly, she out-campaigned me,\" said Kump, 67, finishing his second House term. \"It was a low voter turnout election and she won.\" \n \n Blair's conservative platform meshes with her Eastern Panhandle community, a GOP stronghold filled with Washington, D.C., commuters. \n \n Kump espoused his own brand of quirky conservatism. He sat in the Democratic House's back row with a yellow \"Don't tread on me\" flag on his desk. He occasionally tapped into his inner Dr. Seuss and delivered rhymes in opposition to bills he considered government intrusion. \n \n He also wanted the Eastern Panhandle to return to Virginia, which Blair opposed. \n \n Blair has attended GOP meetings with her dad since the sixth grade and volunteers with various groups. She skipped senior prom to participate in a Youth in Government meeting in Charleston. \n \n \"She has never had a curfew or anything like that,\" Craig Blair said. \"As long as you're performing to the best of your ability, I don't make rules for her.\" \n \n Blair's Democratic opponent, 44-year-old lawyer Layne Diehl, said that it's positive that the teen won the primary, despite their differing views. \n \n \"She certainly has taken on this challenge and I think that she's up to it,\" Diehl said. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Matthew Umstead daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever Matthew Umstead posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nSaira Blair can't legally vote yet, but she managed to rack up a sizable number of votes all the same. The West Virginia 17-year-old emerged victorious in the Republican primary over (two-term) incumbent state delegate Larry Kump, 872-728, on Tuesday. Among the very teenage elements to her campaign, per the Washington Post and the Herald-Mail: She freely gave out her cellphone number to voters and described the job as not \"rocket science by any means.\" Blair, who is pro-gun rights, against abortion, and the daughter of a West Virginia state senator, also outspent the 67-year-old $4,800 to $1,800. She'll be up against Layne Diehl in November in her quest to win a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. If she does so, she'll be the youngest state lawmaker in West Virginia history, reports the AP—and will have to skip the spring semester at West Virginia University, where she's headed in the fall to pursue economics and Spanish degrees.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA 5-year-old boy attacked by a mountain lion outside his home in Colorado on Friday night is in fair condition, officials said. \n \n The boy's mother told police he had been playing in the front yard with his older brother when she heard screaming and ran outside to find a mountain lion on him, the Pitkin Sheriff's Department said in a news release. \n \n The mother told police she was able to pull the boy away from the animal. \n \n The boy's father called 911 to tell dispatchers he was driving his injured son to the hospital just before 8 p.m. local time, authorities said. \n \n Mountain lion numbers have risen recently, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

The boy was playing with his older brother in their yard about 10 miles outside of Aspen when his mother heard screaming. She ran outside to see a mountain lion attacking her young son. According to a police statement quoted by CNN, the boy's mom \"physically removed her son from the mountain lion.\" The boy was rushed to the hospital, where he is in fair condition with injuries to his head, face, and neck. His mom suffered minor injuries to her hands and legs. Pitkin County sheriff's deputies and a US Forest Service officer found the mountain lion under some trees in the family's yard and killed it, the Aspen Times reports. “Since it was still there, it was either injured or very ill, so they dispatched it,” Undersheriff Ron Ryan says. They were also looking for a second mountain lion spotted in the area on Friday. Experts say it's rare to even see a mountain lion in Colorado, let alone be attacked by one. Not even a dozen people have been killed by mountain lions over the past 100 years in North America.\n#END SUMMARY"}

term cure . \n a 59 year old man presented in 1995 with haematuria and bladder outlet obstructive symptoms . clinical examination revealed a large benign prostate greater than 100 grams and a psa of 28ng / ml . \n a year later, he re - presented with clot retention . due to the size of the prostate gland and the fact that it was thought to be benign, \n histology showed mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the prostate with extracellular mucin involving more than 50% of the specimen which was also psa positive . \n mri scan showed an enormous multicystic tumour arising from the prostate gland infiltrating the posterior wall of the bladder and also involving the rectum ( figure 1 ) . \n mri scan showing an enormous multicystic tumour arising from the prostate gland infiltrating the posterior wall of the bladder and also involving the rectum the patient was offered pelvic exenteration but elected to have radical radiotherapy . after radical radiotherapy, psa levels fell to 35ng / ml but post - radiotherapy ct scan showed no response to treatment and no distant metastasis . \n meanwhile, he continued to have haematuria and a debulking transurethral resection of the prostate was needed to control the haematuria . during the procedure, \n three years after his first presentation, the patient became cachetic and he finally agreed to have pelvic exenteration after counselling . \n histology revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma of prostate invading the whole thickness of the bladder only leaving a small area at the dome un - involved and also invading the rectal wall . \n fourteen years later his psa has remained undetectable and there was still no evidence of recurrence on surveillance ct scans . \n mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate is a rare morphological variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma, accounting for an incidence of about 0.2 - 0.4% ( 1,2 ) . \n this diagnosis is established on tumours with more than 25% of the gland containing extracellular mucin ( 3 ) . \n, it can be difficult to diagnose mucinous adenocarcinoma using transrectal needle biopsies since the biopsy samples may not be entirely representative . \n microscopically it displays features of single round and cribriform glands floating within mucinous lakes, staining positive for psa and prostate - specific acid phosphatase and staining negative for cdx2 ( marker for intestinal tumours ) . \n very rarely, it can be associated with intracellular mucin positive signet - ring cells ( 4 ) . \n our case displayed the usual features of mucinous adenocarcinoma without any evidence of signet - ring cells . \n the first interesting finding in our case is the infiltration of bladder with prostatic tumour sparing only a small area at dome . \n due to its rarity and lack of studies with high volume of cases, the natural history and prognosis remains controversial . \n traditionally, it was believed to be associated with an aggressive behaviour and poorer prognosis, but a subsequent case series distinguished that it was the associated signet - ring cell component that resulted a very poor prognosis ( 5 ) . \n in contrast, a match - paired comparison of 14 patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy suggested a favourable prognosis ( 2 ) . \n another study also demonstrated that mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated by radical prostatectomy is not more aggressive than non - mucinous adenocarcinoma ( 4 ), although long - term data was not available . \n our case supports a long - term favourable outcome after radical surgical treatment . in spite of failure of response to initial therapies and \n the locally advanced stage of the disease, the patient remained reccurence free 14 years after first presentation and 11 years after surgery . in the context of this rare variant of prostatic carcinoma, \n we have highlighted a successful curative outcome from radical surgery, despite failed initial hormonal and radiotherapy treatment even in a locally advance disease . \n the favourable outcome of radical surgery suggests that radical surgery should be considered, especially in cases with failed initial treatments .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe management of mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma include hormonal treatment, radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy with variable long -

The U.S. birthrate peaked during the baby boom, at 122.7 in 1957. \n \n Immigrant women, both legal and illegal, still have a higher birthrate than the U.S. population as a whole. Yet the rate ... ||||| Image caption Preliminary data from 2011 shows the lowest birth rate in 90 years \n \n The US birth rate hit a record low last year, led by the decline in child-bearing among foreign-born women, according to a Pew study. \n \n The overall US birth rate decreased by 8% between 2007-10, and by 6% among US-born women, found the data. \n \n The rate fell sharpest for those hardest hit by the recession: 14% among foreign-born women and 23% among Mexican immigrant women in particular. \n \n The 2011 rate was the lowest since 1920, when such records began. \n \n Previous research by Pew concluded that states with the largest economic downturn from 2007-08, were most likely to have experienced fertility declines. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The decline of the macho man among New York's Dominican community \n \n Foreign and US-born Hispanic women have experienced the largest fall in household wealth since 2007. \n \n But increased access to contraception for Latino women may also be playing a part in the falling birth rate, according to the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. \n \n Foreign-born mothers continue to give birth to a disproportionate share of the nation's newborns. \n \n Last year there were 3.95 million total US births, according to the preliminary data from Pew Research Center. \n \n The overall US birth rate was 63.2 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. \n \n It peaked in 1957 during the Baby Boom years, reaching 122.7 per 1,000 women.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe US birthrate last year was the lowest since records began in 1920, dropping to 63.2 per 1,000 women, Pew data shows. Between 2007 and 2010, the rate fell 8% among all women aged 15 to 44. It fell 14% among foreign-born women, compared to 6% among women born in the US. And among Mexican immigrant women, it dropped 23%. The recession appears to have played a major role: Foreign-born women were deeply affected by the downturn, and Hispanic women born in the US and abroad have seen household wealth drop more than any other group since 2007. \"Latinos have been hit particularly hard by the recession, and the downturn in births is especially sharp for immigrants,\" says a study author. Latino women's increased access to contraception may also have been a factor, analysts say. Another factor: Immigration from Mexico hit a net zero in 2010, the Wall Street Journal notes, meaning that the number of Mexicans moving here matched the number returning to Mexico. Some 3.95 million babies were born in the US last year, the data shows. The birth rate peaked in 1957, at 122.7 per 1,000 women, the BBC notes.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Beside sanctions, they are talking about war and negotiations,” he said via his official Twitter account in English. \n \n “In this regard, let me say a few words to the people: THERE WILL BE NO WAR, NOR WILL WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE US.” \n \n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up \n \n There has been widespread speculation over whether Iran would be forced back to the negotiating table following Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions. \n \n Why do we not negotiate with the U.S.? pic.twitter.com/4LDBfDjRw1 — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) August 13, 2018 \n \n But Iran has rejected fresh talks, saying the US can no longer be trusted after violating its commitments under the deal. \n \n In a speech in Tehran, Khamenei also said Monday that the country’s economic problems, exacerbated by the sanctions, were the result of internal mismanagement by the government and not just US pressure. \n \n “Economic experts and many officials believe the cause of this issue is not foreign, it’s internal,” he said in a speech in Tehran, according to tweets released on his official account. \n \n “Not that sanctions don’t have an impact, but the main factor is how we handle them.” \n \n He referred specifically to the collapse of the country’s currency, the rial, which has lost around half its value since April. \n \n “If our performance is better, more prudent, timely and effective, sanctions will not have that much effect and can be resisted,” he added. \n \n The speech was not immediately televised. They are usually broadcast later in the day. \n \n There have been widespread protests and strikes in recent weeks over high prices, unemployment and the wider management of the economy. \n \n Analysts say US hostility, including its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions, helped fuel the run on Iran’s rial. \n \n But many say it has only exacerbated longstanding problems within Iran — and pressure has mounted from within the system on President Hassan Rouhani to improve his management of the economy and tackle corruption. ||||| To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.

BE CAUTIOUS!\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIf anyone was unsure what Iran's supreme leader thought of President Trump's offer to hold talks after the US reimposed \"the most biting sanctions\" on Iran last week, all doubt has been removed, per Reuters. \"I ban holding any talks with America. … America never remains loyal to its promises in talks,\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday, according to Iranian state TV. \"America's withdrawal from the nuclear deal is a clear proof that America cannot be trusted.\" The Times of Israel notes Khamenei's outline on his English Twitter account as to why negotiations are out of the question, in which he calls the US government a \"duplicitous\" one that uses a bait-and-switch-style \"formula\" during talks. \"Even if we ever—impossible as it is—negotiated with the U.S., it would never ever be with the current U.S. administration,\" he adds in a follow-up tweet. Still, Khamenei doesn't see an Iranian-US war coming down the pike anytime soon. \"[The Americans] are exaggerating the possibility of a war with Iran. There will be no war,\" he said, per Reuters, adding a veiled threat on Twitter: \"This is because Islamic Republic and Iranian nation have proved that any transgressor will be stricken a bigger blow.\" Khamenei also took the opportunity during his Monday diatribe to take a jab at Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the country's faltering economy. \"More than the sanctions, economic mismanagement [by the government] is putting pressure on ordinary Iranians,\" he noted. \"I do not call it betrayal but a huge mistake in management.\" (Trump issued an all-caps warning tweet to Iran's president last month.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It is named after songwriting brothers George and Ira Gershwin. \n \n King, now 70, topped the charts with the song “It’s Too Late” in 1971, but is best known for her work performed by others, including “You’ve Got a Friend” by James Taylor and “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” by Aretha Franklin. \n \n “I was so pleased when the venerable Library of Congress began honoring writers of popular songs with the Gershwin Prize,” King said in a statement. “I’m proud to be the fifth such honoree and the first woman among such distinguished company.” \n \n King and Goffin wrote some the biggest hits of the 1960s before their nine-year marriage ended in 1968. They rose to prominence in 1960 writing “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” for the Shirelles. \n \n The duo also scored hits with “Take Good Care of My Baby,” performed by Bobby Vee in 1961, “The Loco-Motion,” performed by Little Eva in 1962 and “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” performed by The Monkees in 1967, among others. \n \n New York-born King did not hit it big as a singer until 1971, when “Tapestry” topped the U.S. album charts for 15 weeks, then a record for a female solo artist. \n \n Past recipients of the award include Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and songwriting tandem Burt Bacharach and Hal David. ||||| Carole King, right, joined by Alicia Keys at a recent salute in Hollywood to King's music, will receive the Library of Congress' 2013 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. (Michael Buckner / Getty Images) \n \n Carole King has been named the 2013 recipient of the Library of Congress’ Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first woman to receive the distinction given to songwriters for a body of work. \n \n The former Brill Building writer co-wrote hits in the 1960s including the Shirelles’ “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” the Chiffons’ “One Fine Day,” the Drifters’ “Up On the Roof” and the Monkees’ “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” among dozens of others, before becoming a star in her own right with her 1971 album “Tapestry,” one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. \n \n King will be feted next spring in Washington, D.C., at a ceremony that typically features the recipient and a variety of top-name performers singing his or her songs. Previous Gershwin Prize winners are Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and the team of Hal David and Burt Bacharach. \n \n “Carole King has been one of the most influential songwriters of our time,” Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “For more than five decades, she has written for and been recorded by many different types of artists for a wide range of audiences, communicating with beauty and dignity the universal human emotions of love, joy, pain and loss. Her body of work reflects the spirit of the Gershwin Prize with its originality, longevity and diversity of appeal.” \n \n In the same statement, King said, “I was so pleased when the venerable Library of Congress began honoring writers of popular songs with the Gershwin Prize. I’m proud to be the fifth such honoree and the first woman among such distinguished company. I look forward to performing in the nation’s capital.” \n \n “Tapestry” earned King a rare diamond award from the Recording Industry Assn. of America in recognition of sales of more than 10 million copies. The collection spent 15 weeks at No. 1 in 1971, earned Grammy Awards as album of the year, record of the year for “It’s Too Late,” song of the year for “You’ve Got a Friend” and female pop vocal to King for the title track. \n \n More than 1,000 performers have recorded more than 400 of her songs, yielding 100 hit singles, according to the Library of Congress. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Ravi Shankar: An appreciation \n \n Review: Rock legends take over Sandy concert \n \n 121212 Concert: The Rolling Stones make a quick exit \n \n Follow Randy Lewis on Twitter: @RandyLewis2\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nCarole King makes a little history next spring when she collects the 2013 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song from the US Library of Congress.

Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused in the shooting rampage nearly a year ago at this massive Army post, could be postponed for another month after Hasan's attorneys made a last-minute request to delay the hearing until Nov. 8. \n \n Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, one of three attorneys for Hasan, asked for the continuance Tuesday to \"process some paperwork.\" Attorneys would not discuss the paperwork in open court and asked Col. James Pohl, the investigating officer serving as judge during the hearing, to close the courtroom to discuss the issue. When Pohl denied the request, defense attorneys asked to postpone the hearing until this morning to give them time to submit a written brief on the need for a continuance. \n \n Prosecutors opposed the delay. Pohl is expected to rule on the motion when the hearing resumes at 9 a.m. today. \n \n The first of dozens of witnesses was expected to begin testifying Tuesday about the shooting at the post's busy Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where 13 were killed and 32 were wounded Nov. 5. More than 120 media members from 40 outlets, including CNN and Al-Jazeera, gathered in the pre-dawn darkness hours before the hearing. \n \n Inside the wood-paneled courtroom filled with computer monitors and television screens, a handful of relatives of victims sat on the stadium-style seating in the gallery, which accommodates about 30 onlookers. \n \n Clad in a standard olive and beige camouflage Army uniform and a standard issue green knit cap, Hasan looked pale but alert as he was wheeled into the courtroom by a Fort Hood police officer after a lengthy delay while lawyers discussed the possible continuance. Although paralyzed from the chest down from bullet wounds received during the shooting, Hasan is able to move his arms and frequently touched his face during the hearing. \n \n In past court appearances, a chilled Hasan has been wrapped in blankets, but he didn't use any Tuesday. His attorney has said he struggles to maintain his core body temperature because of the paralysis. \n \n The Article 32 hearing is the first step in what many legal experts expect will result in a death penalty trial for Hasan. At the end of the hearing, which is scheduled to last at least four weeks, Pohl will recommend whether Hasan should face a court-martial. Fort Hood commanders will make the final decision on whether Hasan goes to trial and what penalty he will face. \n \n Tuesday's request for a continuance is the latest in a string of delay petitions from Hasan's attorneys, who have complained that they have not received stacks of discovery evidence, including classified portions of investigations ordered by the White House after the shooting. \n \n Hasan's civilian attorney, John Galligan, did not address the media after the hearing, as he has done after previous procedural hearings. \n \n jschwartz@statesman.com; 912-2942 ||||| Army Col. James Pohl he told the defense it could put its arguments for the continuance into writing rather than air them in court. Defense attorneys did not want to explain their reasons publicly. \n \n \"I believe that would protect your client's interest,\" Pohl said, adding that he would \"give you that option rather than discuss it in open court.\" \n \n Pohl is acting as an investigating officer in an Article 32 hearing that will determine whether Hasan, an Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens of others in a Nov. 5 shooting spree, goes to trial. \n \n Often likened to a grand jury, Article 32 hearings are a routine first step toward trial. Pohl's task is to gather evidence and then tell commanders if a trial should be ordered. \n \n Hasan's attorneys have called for continuances in previous hearings. They've unsuccessfully sought to close the hearing, citing heavy publicity they say threatens their client's fair-trial rights. \n \n Paralyzed from the chest down, Hasan, 40, is charged with 13 specifications of premeditated murder and 32 specifications of attempted premeditated murder. The Army hasn't said whether it would seek the death penalty, but Hasan's lead attorney, retired Army Col. John Galligan, has insisted that's their goal. \n \n Pohl ordered a recess until today after giving the defense the rest of the afternoon and evening to draft a brief explaining its reasons for seeking a continuance. \n \n It is not clear if the defense's brief would be made public after Pohl's review. Neither Galligan nor other members of the defense team met with the news media, but retired Army Lt. Col. Tom Rheinlander, the post's chief spokesman, said the defense was given until midnight Tuesday to file its brief. He took no questions. \n \n \"The investigating officer will reconvene the meeting at 9 a.m. to hear arguments of the defense motion,\" he said. \n \n sigc@express-news.net\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe trial of the Army psychiatrist accused in the Fort Hood shooting rampage may be delayed. A pretrial hearing at the military base's courtroom for Maj. Nidal Hasan was scheduled to begin yesterday, but the defense team asked for a month to \"process some paperwork,\" finds the Austin American Statesman. The judge is considering the request and will rule on it today. The military hearing, known as an Article 32, is the first step in a process experts expect will end in a death penalty trial for Hasan, who is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more, notes the Houston Chronicle. Hasan, paralyzed from the chest down from bullet wounds he received during the rampage, did not speak during the hearing.

Photo: AP \n \n MANILA—Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has developed a reputation for cursing after calling U.S. President Barack Obama a “son of a whore,” said Friday that he had promised God he would stop swearing. \n \n Mr. Duterte said that late at night while everyone was snoring on a flight back to the Philippines from Japan, he had heard a voice that said if he didn’t stop swearing, “I will bring this plane down now.” \n \n The... ||||| DAVAO CITY – While on his way home Thursday night from his three-day state visit to Japan, President Rodrigo Duterte promised to God he would stop swearing. \n \n “While on up there on my way here, I heard a voice telling me to stop swearing or the plane will crash in midair, and so I promised to stop,” Duterte said, shortly before delivering an arrival speech at the Davao International Airport. \n \n “A promise to God is a promise to the people,” the President, known for his penchant for cussing, said. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n But when asked later whether he would no longer curse when talking about the United States, the European Union, and even Sen. Leila de Lima, Duterte said that would depend on the right timing. \n \n “May timing iyan,” he said. “Yung mga kababata ko, alam nila iyan.” ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Duterte was on a flight home after a visit to Japan \n \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he has promised God he will clean up his famously vulgar language. \n \n Arriving in his home city of Davao after a trip to Japan, Mr Duterte said God gave him an ultimatum on the plane. \n \n \"I heard a voice telling me to stop swearing or the plane will crash in mid-air, and so I promised to stop,\" he told reporters at the airport. \n \n Mr Duterte's blunt speaking, often directed at the West, has contributed to his popularity at home. \n \n He called President Barack Obama a \"son of a whore\", called the European Union \"hypocritical\", threatened to leave the UN and accepted comparisons to Hitler, saying he would gladly kill three million drug addicts. \n \n All were responses to criticisms of his bloody war on drugs, that has seen thousands of alleged drug dealers and users killed by police and vigilante groups. \n \n Mr Duterte said he had promised God he would not \"express slang, cuss words and everything\", and said a \"promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people\". \n \n But he suggested his promise might have its limits. Whether he will stick to not swearing when talking about the US, EU or arch political foe Senator Leila de Lima, will depend on timing, local media quoted him as saying. \n \n Like most Filipinos, Mr Duterte is Roman Catholic, although he has boasted about his womanising and called the Pope a \"son of a whore\" for causing traffic jams during his visit. \n \n The president has spoken about being abused by an American priest as a child, saying that informed his political views. \n \n He recently said that the Philippines wanted \"a separation\" from long-standing ally the US, and wanted American troops to leave the country, possibly within two years.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWhen God calls, it's probably wise to answer—and for Rodrigo Duterte, that means to stop swearing like a sailor. Per the BBC, the Philippines president says he was flying home to Davao from Japan when something happened to make him reconsider his infamous potty mouth. \"I heard a voice telling me to stop swearing or the plane will crash in midair, and so I promised to stop,\" he told reporters at the airport, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reports. \"I will bring this plane down now,\" he says the voice warned, per the Wall Street Journal, noting that he plans to keep his word, as \"a promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.\" He noted, however, there may be caveats to this vow when he's talking about the US or the EU, in which his cussing would \"depend on timing,\" the BBC notes. Per the Journal, he joked with the reporters that if they applauded \"too much\" about his decision, he might change his mind. (If you really mean it, Rodrigo, that means no more calling President Obama a \"son of a b----.\")\n#END SUMMARY"}

The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nto date no violation of the symmetry of cpt has been observed .\nthe cpt theorem predicts that particles and antiparticles have identical ( or sign -

Tennis is one of the ultimate tests of endurance this world has to offer. It would be seemingly impossible for anybody to perform at a high level with this syndrome slowly eating away at their body during a match. \n \n \"Sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by degeneration of the mucus-secreting glands, particularly the tear ducts of the eyes (lacrimal) and saliva glands of the mouth. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack healthy tissue. Sjogren syndrome is also associated with inflammatory disorders such as arthritis or lupus,\" according to WebMD.com. \n \n If there was ever a woman who could overcome something of this magnitude, it would be Venus. Venus and her sister Serena have overcome adversity after adversity during their careers. This is another obstacle attempting to impede her path from going down as the greatest women’s tennis player in history. \n \n We can only hope for the sake of the sport and her well-being that a cure is out there to control this limiting disease. We need Venus back on the court as soon as possible, but not at the expense of her well-being. That is what is most important right now. \n \n Sjogren’s Syndrome will surely shorten her career unless it can be controlled. Venus did the right thing by pulling out of the US Open. Hopefully with the right medical attention and time away from the game, Venus can come back to wow us like she always does. \n \n Fatigue and joint pain is devastating for any person, let alone a tennis player. Still, I would expect Venus to return to the hallowed court sooner than we would ever imagine. We rarely ever see people as determined as the Williams sisters. She will prepare like a mad-woman to get into better shape to counter the disease and guarantee we have the privilege of watching her wage in battle again. ||||| What is Sjögren's? \n \n Sjögren's is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects the entire body.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nthe day when a vaginal plug was observed is designated as embryonic day ( e ) 0.5 and the day of birth as postnatal ( p ) day 0 . \n golgi labeling was performed as described ( fd neurotechnologies ) . for in utero electroporation, e13.5 embryos from timed - pregnant wt and npn-2 females from homozygous crosses were used . \n wt p5 dentate gyrus hippocampi, and wt or npn-2 e14.5 cortices, were dissected and dissociated for primary culture experiments . \n see supplemental methods for additional experimental procedures, including : tem, serial 3-d reconstruction, immunocytochemistry, physiological recordings, and quantification parameters for spine density, synaptic puncta, sholl analysis, and ap - fluorescence .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian cns are formed on dendritic spines1, and spine morphology and distribution are critical for synaptic transmission26, synaptic integration and plasticity7 . here, we show that a secreted semaphorin, sema3f, is a negative regulator of spine development and synaptic structure . \n mice with null mutations in genes encoding sema3f, and its holoreceptor components neuropilin-2 ( npn-2 ) and plexina3 ( plexa3 ), exhibit increased dentate gyrus ( dg ) granule cell ( gc ) and cortical layer v pyramidal neuron spine number and size, and also aberrant spine distribution . \n moreover, sema3f promotes loss of spines and excitatory synapses in dissociated neurons in vitro, and in npn-2/ brain slices cortical layer v and dg gcs exhibit increased mepsc frequency . \n in contrast, a distinct sema3a  npn-1/plexa4 signaling cascade controls basal dendritic arborization in layer v cortical neurons but does not influence spine morphogenesis or distribution . \n these disparate effects of secreted semaphorins are reflected in the restricted dendritic localization of npn-2 to apical dendrites and of npn-1 to all dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons . \n therefore, sema3f signaling controls spine distribution along select dendritic processes, and distinct secreted semaphorin signaling events orchestrate cns connectivity through the differential control of spine morphogenesis, synapse formation, and the elaboration of dendritic morphology .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDrama! 'Dancing with the Stars' insider says Kate Gosselin is always late for hair and makeup \n \n Larkey/ABC A 'Dancing with the Stars' insider says Kate Gosselin is notorious for being late to hair and makeup. \n \n There's already been drama along with the dips on this season's \"Dancing With the Stars\": Sources say that despite the lineup of known prima donnas like Shannen Doherty and Pamela Anderson, it's Kate Gosselin who's causing the trouble. \n \n The worst of the reality TV mom's antics? Her out-of-control tardiness. \n \n \"Kate shows up late for hair and makeup every time,\" a show insider says of the rehearsals that led to Monday night's opener, which drew a record-breaking 22.8 million viewers. \n \n A rep for the ABC program says, \"Kate is always on time and is a pleasure to work with,\" but the insider begged to differ. \n \n \"The staff has warned her and lectured her about being late, but Kate just gets angry and blows them off,\" says the source. \"No one wants to deal with her.\" \n \n While such behavior may be expected from the notoriously short-fused Gosselin, the spy says the \"Dancing\" staff initially feared that former \"Beverly Hills 90210\" star Doherty would be the troublesome hoofer. \n \n \"Everyone had heard the stories of Shannen's behavior on sets when she was younger,\" says the source. \"But she's been one of the easiest people to work with. She's practically the opposite of Kate.\" \n \n The same can be said for their onstage performances. While Shannen did well on the show's premiere, Kate tanked. In fact, the judges placed her third to last with a score of 16 out of 30, putting her just in front of 80-year-old former astronaut Buzz Aldrin. \n \n It's not just her pliés that Kate may be having trouble with. Our insider says the demographic she's trying to impress just isn't going to buy it. \n \n \"Kate tried to appeal to the housewife vote by saying, 'This is for all the moms out there!'\" sneers the source. \"But really, what kind of mom leaves their kids at home for a dance competition?\" ||||| A whopping 24 million viewers tuned in for Monday's premiere of 'Dancing With the Stars.' Much of that attention was, let's face it, due to the curiosity of watching Kate Gosselin do her thing. Among those watching was, who visited HLN's 'The Joy Behar Show' last night to give his take on Kate's so-called \"disaster\" of a night. Not only does Rob not think Gosselin will go home any time soon, he thinks, \"She's gonna win this show.\"Rob also says, \"A friend of Kate's told me that if she thinks she's gonna be in the bottom two, expect eight little faces to be in the front row next week!\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nKate Gosselin failed to impress at her Dancing With the Stars debut—and it turns out she’s just as awful off the dance floor as on. “Kate shows up late for hair and makeup every time,” an insider tells the New York Daily News, and when confronted about it by staff, she “just gets angry and blows them off. No one wants to deal with her.” The source—clearly not a member of Team Kate—adds that the reality show mom probably won’t get the votes, either. “Kate tried to appeal to the housewife vote by saying, ‘This is for all the moms out there!’ But really, what kind of mom leaves their kids at home for a dance competition?” If Kate does find herself in the bottom two, she has eight little strategies for gaining the sympathy vote—for more on that, click here.\n#END SUMMARY"}

That's even better than Disney's record-breaking animated hit, Frozen, which dropped 53 percent in its second week after Thanksgiving in 2013. \n \n Moana has earned $119.9 million domestically and $177.4 million globally. Overseas, the film launched in five new markets (France, Spain, the U.K., Russia and Mexico) to join China, where it bowed last weekend. China posted an estimated $5.5 million for the weekend (a drop-off of just 55 percent) for a cume of $21.3 million in the country. \n \n Warner Bros.' Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them earned $18.5 million this week to land at No. 2. The Eddie Redmayne-starring pic, with a domestically tally of $183.5 million, dropped just 59 percent in its third week. \n \n Fantastic Beasts was the No. 1 film internationally for the third week in a row, earning $60.4 million in an estimated 67 foreign markets and bringing its tally abroad to $424.4 million. It has earned north of $600 million worldwide to date. \n \n Another holdover doing strong business is Paramount's sci-fi film Arrival. In its fourth week, it pulled in $7.3 million, to edge out Paramount's other film Allied for the No. 3 spot. Arrival, benefiting from positive reviews and strong word of mouth, has earned $73 million domestically to date. \n \n Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, took in $7.1 million in its second week, and has earned $28.9 million to date. The film also collected $12.1 million from 36 foreign markets this weekend, including 13 new openings, for an international tally of $24.8 million. In China, where Pitt is considered one of the biggest global stars, the spy thriller earned a soft $3.6 million from 10,000 locations. \n \n Disney also landed in the top five twice this weekend, with its Marvel film Doctor Strange taking in $6.5 million. With a domestic cume of $215.3 million, the Benedict Cumberbatch-starrer has now passed 2013's Thor: The Dark World ($206 million). Doctor Strange also has grossed $634.9 million globally to surpass 2010's Iron Man 2 ($624 million). \n \n The weekend's only new wide release, BH Tilt’s Incarnate, opened to an estimated $2.6 million from 1,737 locations. It's a quiet start for the $5 million horror movie, which was aiming to do business similar to BH Tilt’s last film, The Darkness, which had a strong $4.95 million opening weekend in May. \n \n The Aaron Eckhart-starring microbudget pic, however, had a more focused — and less costly — marketing plan, which targeted die-hard genre fans through through digitally focused outreach. The campaign, funded by Universal, cost in the low single-digit millions. \n \n \n \n The audience for Incarnate was 47 percent Caucasian, 26 percent Hispanic and 18 percent African-American. \n \n On the limited release front, Fox Searchlight opened Jackie in five theaters to $275,000 for a per-screen average of $55,000. The film, starring Natalie Portman and which is gathering awards buzz, was bought by Searchlight at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. \n \n Amazon and Roadside’s Manchester by the Sea, which picked up several awards and nominations this week, earned another $2.36 million as it expanded to 156 locations. The Kenneth Lonergan-directed, Casey Affleck-starring drama, buoyed by its awards buzz, should land in the No. 10 spot at the domestic box office this week.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nMoana goosed $28.4 million out of a sleepy December weekend, good enough for first place for the second weekend in a row, notes the Hollywood Reporter. Disney's animated offering, which fell short of Frozen's record last week, now has $119.9 million domestically. Meanwhile, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them checked in at No. 2 with $18.5 million, while Arrival made $7.3 million for third, which edged out Allied's $7.1 million. Disney scored another hit in the top five, with Doctor Strange taking in $6.5 million. Incarnate fell well short of what the AP calls \"modest expectations,\" reeling in $2.6 million.\n#END SUMMARY"}

You’d think the Queen’s approval would give the breed more cachet,” owner Brittany Ng, 28, of Sacramento, Calif. told The Post. \n \n “The idea that they’re less popular is concerning. To me, he’s the perfect package.” \n \n But dog-show experts claim England’s tail-docking ban has spoiled the look of the herding dog, prompting some breeders to stop selling them completely. \n \n “We have lost a lot of our big kennels, a lot have just given up . . . The breeders are now just hobbyists,” leading corgi breeder Diana King told the Telegraph. ||||| Queen's beloved corgis 'becoming endangered' \n \n (AFP) – Nov 4, 2013 \n \n London — Queen Elizabeth II's favourite dog breed, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, is at risk of disappearing, Britain's Kennel Club breeders' association has warned. \n \n Known for their short legs and yappy voices, the herding dogs have been favoured by the British monarchy since the 1930s and the queen, 87, has raised dozens herself. \n \n But the Kennel Club said that with just 241 Pembroke Welsh Corgis registered in Britain this year, the breed is on its \"at watch\" list and is set to be classed as a \"vulnerable native breed\" by January. \n \n \"It looks unlikely to reach the 300 registrations needed to stay off the vulnerable native breeds list,\" the organisation said in a statement. \n \n Right-leaning newspaper The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline of the corgi on the previous Labour government, which lost power in 2010 to a coalition led by Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives. \n \n Labour introduced a law in 2007 banning \"tail-docking\" -- the practice of cutting off part of a dog's tail -- leading many breeders to abandon the corgi after it changed the breed's appearance, the Telegraph argued. \n \n The queen currently has two corgis, Holly and Willow, as well as two dorgis -- a cross-breed of dachshund and corgi -- named Candy and Vulcan, according to the monarchy's official website. \n \n The Kennel Club said the decline of native breeds such as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been accompanied in Britain by the \"astronomical\" rise of small foreign breeds that can fit inside a handbag, such as the French bulldog. \n \n Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More »\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIn a serious threat to adorable viral videos, it appears corgis are facing the dog-breed equivalent of endangerment. With just 241 Pembroke Welsh Corgis registered this year, the breed is currently on Britain's Kennel Club's \"at watch list\": if 300 aren't registered by January, they'll be considered a \"vulnerable native breed,\" the New York Post reports. And reaching 300 \"looks unlikely,\" the Kennel Club says of Queen Elizabeth's favored breed, per AFP. So what's hurting corgis' numbers? According to the Telegraph, it could be the matter of tail-docking, banned in Britain in 2007. Apparently breeders don't like the full-tail look: \"We have lost a lot of our big kennels.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDays later, while sitting in a New Orleans jail, Durst gave a nearly three-hour interview to prosecutors from Los Angeles who were investigating his links to the slaying of Susan Berman, the friend of Durst's who was discovered with a single bullet wound to the back of the head in Beverly Hills. Durst has since been charged with that murder. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Andrew Blankstein, Hannah Rappleye and Tracy Connor \n \n Los Angeles prosecutors have released a transcript of a 2015 interrogation of millionaire murder suspect Robert Durst in which he says he can't provide details about the disappearance of his first wife and the murder of a close friend because it would amount to \"pleading guilty.\" \n \n Durst, 73, then mused aloud about what would be in it for him to give information about the two women to investigators. \n \n \"As I see it, all you could for me is tell me that 'this is the best prison in California and that I will recommend you go there,\" the real-estate heir said, according to the transcript. \n \n Real estate heir Robert Durst, right, sits with his Attorney Dick De Guerin during a long-awaited appearance in a courtroom in Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 7, 2016. Kevork Djansezian / Pool Photo via AP \n \n The conversation with Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin took place shortly after Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a warrant out of Los Angeles. \n \n Authorities in LA have since charged him with the 2000 murder of confidante Susan Berman, allegedly killed because she knew too much about the 1982 vanishing of Kathie Durst, who is presumed dead. \n \n Durst danced around questions about both women in the interview, sometimes saying he was going to \"stay away\" from talking about certain aspects, according to the transcript. \n \n \"You'd like some details from me about if I knew where Kathie's body is,\" Durst said to the prosecutor at one point. \"And about what happened with Susan.\" \n \n When Lewin said that's what he wanted, Durst said, \"If I tell you those things, I'm pleading guilty.\" \n \n Durst has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said the interview with their client, outside the presence of his attorneys, was an \"improper interrogation.\" \n \n The transcript, which was released as part of a motion ahead of a hearing next Wednesday, also contained the following revelations: \n \n • Durst says he was on methamphetamines when he filmed the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx,\" which examined his ties to Kathie Durst's disappearance, Berman's slaying and the 2003 dismemberment of a neighbor in Texas. The series ended with Durst muttering into a hot mic that he \"killed them all.\" \n \n \"The whole time I was on meth,\" Durst told the prosecutor, according to the transcript. \"I think the reason I did it had to be because I was swooped, speeding.\" He also said that he smoked pot every day for as long as he could remember. \n \n • Durst said he only had five years left to live after losing his esophagus to cancer and struggling with hydrocephalous, or fluid on the brain. \n \n \"So there's not much I could agree with anybody that somebody could offer me, unless they could offer me more life,\" he said when Lewin asked him about his hopes for the future. \n \n • Durst said he didn't flee right after \"The Jinx\" wrapped, when he was confronted with a damning piece of newly unearthed evidence, because of \"inertia.\" \n \n Durst, who was allegedly on his way to Cuba when he was caught in New Orleans, also said that he really doesn't like life on the run. \n \n \"Being a fugitive was not something I did well,\" he said. \"I was the worst fugitive the world has ever met.\" \n \n • Durst seemed unsure of whether he has Asperger’s syndrome, which is on the spectrum of autism disorders, as his lawyers have claimed. \n \n “I never thought that amounted to anything,” he told Lewin. But then he added, “The thing with Asperger’s syndrome is intelligent people don’t get along or don’t enjoy communicating with other people. And that is certainly me.” \n \n Durst denies killing Berman. He has not been charged in connection with Kathie Durst's apparent death but denies killing her in the interview with Lewin. \n \n \"If you had killed Susan, would you tell me?\" Lewin asked him. \n \n \"No,\" Durst said. \n \n Durst was acquitted of the murder of Texas neighbor Morris Black after he argued he killed him in self-defense and dismembered his body in a panic. He is currently serving a seven-year sentence for gun possession.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nRobert Durst in November pleaded not guilty to the 2000 murder of best friend Susan Berman, a plea that came more than a year and a half after HBO's The Jinx aired him muttering, \"killed them all\" into a hot mic. Now, new claims about that comment, which led to his 2015 arrest in New Orleans, and more comments about the death of Berman and the presumed death of Durst's missing first wife. The revelations stem from a transcript of an hours-long jailhouse interview Durst gave to Los Angeles prosecutors after that arrest; the document was released Friday and reported on by the Los Angeles Times. In it, the now 73-year-old said he was \"on meth the whole time\" the documentary was being filmed. \"It should have been obvious.\" The Times reports LA County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Lewin asked the real-estate heir point-blank: \"If you had killed Susan, would you tell me?\" Durst's reply: \"No.\" NBC News zeroes in on other points in Durst's interview with Lewin. \"You'd like some details from me about if I knew where Kathie [Durst]'s body is. And about what happened with Susan.\" When Lewin replied in the affirmative, Durst responded, \"If I tell you those things, I'm pleading guilty.\" When Lewin expressed surprise that Durst didn't try to get out of the country before The Jinx aired, Durst cited \"inertia\" and said \"being a fugitive was not something I did well. I was the worst fugitive the world has ever met.\" (The documentary spurred Kathie Durst's family to action.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe Rolling Stones will perform a groundbreaking concert in Havana, Cuba on Friday March 25, 2016.

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign said Wednesday morning that it had “nothing polite to say” about Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election. \n \n A top advisor to Sanders told CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny: “We have nothing polite to say right now.” ||||| Bernie Sanders was one of the last major politicians to release a statement that responded to Donald Trump's presidential victory. \n \n One of his advisers started the day by telling CNN's Jeff Zelaney, \"We have nothing nice to say right now,\" when asked to comment. \n \n In the evening, Sanders' office finally provided an official statement. In it, Sanders did not offer congratulations. \n \n \"Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids — all while the very rich become much richer.\" \n \n He then outlined exactly where he could find common ground with the Republican — and where he could not. \n \n \"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — Hillary Clinton apologized Friday after gay-rights and AIDS activists assailed her for saying Nancy Reagan helped start a \"national conversation\" about AIDS in the 1980s, when protesters were struggling to get more federal help in fighting the disease. \n \n Clinton, one of two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, made her initial comments in an interview with MSNBC during its coverage of Nancy Reagan's funeral. \n \n Soon after the interview aired, MSNBC's Twitter feed was flooded with comments accusing Clinton of misrepresenting history and insulting the 1980s activists who pressured elected officials to step up the response to AIDS. Clinton soon apologized. \n \n \"While the Reagans were strong advocates for stem cell research and finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, I misspoke about their record on HIV and AIDS. For that, I am sorry,\" Clinton said on her Twitter account. \n \n Many activists remain bitter at Ronald Reagan and his administration for what they view as a devastatingly slow response to AIDS. Though initial reports of the disease surfaced in 1981, President Reagan did not make his first public speech about it until 1987, by which time it had killed more than 20,000 Americans \n \n In her MSNBC interview, Clinton was complimentary to both Reagans with regard to their stance on AIDS. \n \n \"Because of both President and Mrs. Reagan — in particular Mrs. Reagan — we started a national conversation when before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it,\" Clinton said. \n \n \"And you know that too is something that I really appreciate with her very effective, low-key advocacy but it penetrated the public conscience. And people began to say, 'Hey, we have to do something about this too.'\" \n \n Peter Staley, a veteran AIDS activist based in New York, tweeted that Clinton's remarks were \"the most offensive thing possible 4 my generation of LGBT Americans.\" \n \n Clinton, in her race against Bernie Sanders, has received extensive support for LGBT advocacy groups and donors. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT rights group, has endorsed her, incurring some criticism from Sanders supporters who say his record on LGBT rights is strong. \n \n The president of the Human Rights Campaign, Chad Griffin, issued a brief statement Friday that avoided any criticism of Clinton. \n \n \"While I respect her advocacy in other areas including stem cell and Parkinson's research, Nancy Reagan was, sadly, no hero in the fight against HIV,\" Griffin said. \n \n Tanya Domi, a New York-based LGBT activist and staunch Clinton supporter, was relieved by the candidate's speedy apology. \n \n \"There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is very tired and committed a gaff,\" Domi said on Facebook. \"At the same time, keep in mind the Clinton Global Initiative's work on HIV/AIDS has saved millions of people's lives. Millions. But she made a mistake and quickly corrected herself. That is good enough for me.\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nHillary Clinton apologized Friday after gay-rights and AIDS activists assailed her for saying Nancy Reagan helped start a \"national conversation\" about AIDS in the 1980s, when protesters were struggling to get more federal help in fighting the disease, the AP reports.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nFILE - In this April 26, 2010 file photo, actress Jennifer Grey arrives at the premiere of \"Iron Man 2\" at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.

Shortly after he left, police arrived with a K-9 they were using to track Mallett from the bank robbery. \n \n Using the Uber app, police were able to follow Mallett’s location back to the restaurant where he allegedly used the stolen money to pay his bill and even tip the waitress. \n \n Mallett was charged with unarmed robbery and false report of an explosive device. Police said there were also active warrants charging him with larceny over $250, larceny under $250, larceny of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. \n \n © 2016 Cox Media Group. ||||| Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. \n \n Weymouth Police Department \n \n Technology companies tell us they've made us more independent. \n \n We just tap on our phones and so many services are instantly ours. \n \n Getaway cars by Uber, for example. \n \n A man allegedly tried to rob the Santander Bank in Weymouth, Massachusetts, on Monday by passing a note to the teller saying he had a bomb. \n \n In a Facebook post, the Weymouth Police Department said that a witness noted that the man ran from the bank, but then jumped into an Uber. \n \n Police followed an Uber, a Nissan Altima, and arrested 29-year-old Luis Mallett. Police said he was in possession of $700, which the department says corresponds to the amount of money stolen. \n \n Mallett was charged with unarmed robbery and a false report about an explosive device because of the note. \n \n The idea of using the Uber ride-hailing service as a getaway car isn't a first. \n \n Last October, a Maryland man apparently had the same idea after he allegedly robbed a bank. \n \n Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n I imagine, though, that using an Uber instead as a getaway car means you don't have to split the proceeds with the driver and, even more importantly, you don't have to trust anyone else. \n \n Of course, there is the small matter of Uber rides leaving enormous technological trails. And don't you have to book an Uber using your real name? \n \n Perhaps, though, bank robbers don't think that far ahead. \n \n Perhaps they're just enthralled by the technology at their fingertips. ||||| A Weymouth man who couldn’t pay his tab at the 99 Restaurant told the bartender he’d be right back — then went off to rob a bank, and Ubered back an hour later with a stack of cash, settled up, and left the bartender a $20 tip, cops said. \n \n On the way out of the bank, police said, Luis Mallett, 29, paid an unwitting bystander $10 to hail him an Uber, which — thanks to the ride-hailing app’s GPS feature — led police right to him. ||||| See more of Weymouth Police Department on Facebook\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIf you're going to be a 21st-century bank robber, you have to use every modern convenience at your disposal, including flagging an Uber vehicle as your getaway car. CNET reports that a man identified as 29-year-old Luis Mallett allegedly robbed a Santander Bank in Weymouth, Mass., on Monday, giving the teller a note that said he had a bomb and making off with $700. Per a Weymouth Police Department Facebook post, a witness says Mallett then hopped into a built-for-speed red Nissan Altima, which promptly puttered off. Per FOX25, prosecutors say a local man had been approached by Mallett, who said his sister was in trouble and he needed an Uber ASAP. The man says he arranged for an Uber for Mallett on his cellphone. Police were able to use the Uber app to track Mallett back to a local restaurant, where he apparently needed the money to pay his bar tab and tip his server (cops say he left a $20 gratuity for his bartender on a $16 check, per the Boston Herald). He was found with exactly the amount of money on him that the bank had said was stolen, police note. He was charged with unarmed robbery and issuing a false report about an explosive device (for the bomb note); he also had seven outstanding warrants for his arrest for larceny and other charges.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nplzf mice were generated by inserting a sequence encoding an ires and egfp - cre fusion protein immediately after the zbtb16 stop codon through homologous recombination in c57bl/6j embryonic stem cells . for fate - mapping, they were crossed to mice carrying a rosa26-fl - stop - fl - yfp or a rosa26-fl - stop - fl - tdtomato allele . \n bone marrow chimeras were generated by reconstituting lethally irradiated recipients with purified lin sca-1 ckit ( lsk ) bone marrow cells . \n plzf ilc precursors were purified from bone marrow or fetal liver and cultured in bulk or as single - cells deposited by flow cytometry in 96-well plates with irradiated op9 or op9-dl1 stromal cells and mil-7 and mscf . for in vivo transfers, plzf ilc precursors and clp were purified from bone marrow and injected into rag2il2rg mice .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nInnate lymphoid cells ( ilc ) specialize in the rapid secretion of polarized sets of cytokines and chemokines to combat infection and promote tissue repair at mucosal barriers.19 their diversity and similarities with previously characterized nk cells and lymphoid tissue inducers ( lti ) have prompted a provisional classification of all innate lymphocytes into groups 1, 2 and 3 based solely on cytokine properties,10 but their developmental pathways and lineage relationships remain elusive . using lineage tracing and transfer studies, we identified and characterized a novel subset of lymphoid precursors in fetal liver and adult bone marrow that transiently expressed high amounts of plzf, a transcription factor previously associated with nkt cell development.11,12 plzfhigh cells were committed ilc progenitors with multiple ilc1, ilc2 and ilc3 potential at the clonal level . \n they excluded classical lti and nk cells, but included a peculiar subset of nk1.1+dx5  nk - like cells residing in the liver . \n deletion of plzf markedly altered the development of several ilc subsets, but not lti or nk cells . \n plzfhigh precursors also expressed high amounts of id2 and gata3, as well as tox, a known regulator of plzf - independent nk and lti lineages.13 these findings establish novel lineage relationships between ilc, nk and lti cells, and identify the common precursor to ilc, termed ilcp . \n they also reveal the broad, defining role of plzf in the differentiation of innate lymphocytes .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nEEOC Sues Walmart for Discriminating Against Employee with Intellectual Disability \n \n Retail Giant Refused to Make a Simple Accommodation for a Longtime Employee, Federal Agency Charges \n \n MILWAUKEE, Wis. - Walmart violated federal law when it failed to accommodate and fired a longtime employee because of her disability, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed today. \n \n According to EEOC's lawsuit, Marlo Spaeth, who has Down syndrome, was disciplined for absenteeism after her schedule of 15 years was changed by management. Managers at Walmart ignored Spaeth's repeated requests to work her usual shift of 12:00pm - 4:00pm, insisting instead that she work the longer and later shifts that were assigned to her by a new computerized scheduling system. Because of Spaeths's disability, she was unable to adapt to the change in routine. \n \n Spaeth's sister, Amy Stevenson, who acts as her guardian, became involved after disciplinary actions resulted in Spaeth's termination. Ms. Stevenson tried to protect her sister's rights under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), demanding that Walmart rehire Spaeth and allow her to work her preferred schedule of 12:00pm to 4:00pm as a reasonable accommodation. Walmart refused, failing again to accommodate Spaeth, in violation of the ADA. EEOC filed suit (EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-70), in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement though its conciliation process. The lawsuit asks the court to order Walmart to reinstate Ms. Spaeth with appropriate back pay as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit also seeks a permanent injunction enjoining Walmart from failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for disability and discharging an employee due to a disability. \n \n Marlo Spaeth had a long record of successful employment with Walmart, receiving multiple pay raises and satisfactory performance reviews over the years. Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the Chicago District, said, \"Walmart's refusal to accommodate such a simple scheduling request here is not only a violation of the ADA, it's also an example of how easily a successful 15-year career can be harmed by disability discrimination. EEOC will continue to fight ADA violations and uphold the rights of people with disabilities.\" \n \n \"Even the nation's largest private employer must comply with the law's requirement to make a good faith effort to accommodate an employee with a disability,\" said Julianne Bowman, district director of the Chicago District. EEOC's Chicago District is responsible for investigating charges of employment discrimination, administrative enforcement, and the conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. \n \n EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

Marlo Spaeth, who worked at the store for 15 years, was terminated from the company after repeatedly failing to show up for work after her schedule was changed. \n \n According to the lawsuit, Spaeth worked from 12:00 p.m. to 4 p.m. for 15 years and struggled to adapt to her new schedule, which was changed by a computer system to include longer and later shifts. After her hours were changed, Spaeth asked her managers to switch her schedule back to what she was accustomed, requests all denied by her managers. Spaeth was then disciplined for failing to complete shifts until she was ultimately fired. \n \n The EEOC’s lawsuit alleges firing Spaeth violates the Americans With Disabilities Act, which protects people with disabilities from discrimination and requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. \n \n “Walmart’s refusal to accommodate such a simple scheduling request here is not only a violation of the ADA, it’s also an example of how easily a successful 15-year career can be harmed by disability discrimination,” Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the Chicago District, said in an EEOC press release. \n \n A spokesperson for Walmart replied to The Mighty’s request for comment, stating:\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe US Equal Employment Opportunities Commission is suing Walmart for allegedly violating the Americans With Disabilities Act after the company fired an employee with Down syndrome, the Mighty reports. Marlo Spaeth had worked at a Walmart in Milwaukee for 15 years. According to the EEOC, she was a good employee who earned raises and satisfactory performance reviews while working noon to 4pm shifts. Then in November 2014, a new computerized scheduling system changed Spaeth's hours, making them later and longer. Amy Jo Stevenson, Spaeth's sister and guardian, tells the Manitowoc Herald Times Reporter her sister's Down syndrome makes it so she can't easily change her \"habits and rituals,\" and Spaeth started having trouble with attendance at work. Spaeth asked for her old hours back, but Walmart refused. Stevenson says Walmart claimed the new scheduling system wouldn't let them make changes. Spaeth was fired in July 2015. Walmart says Spaeth understood it was important she work her full shift but continually failed to do so. The EEOC wants Spaeth rehired to her original schedule with back pay and damages. It argues Walmart must \"make a good-faith effort to accommodate an employee with a disability,\" and an EEOC lawyer faults the company for allowing a \"simple scheduling request\" to end a 15-year career. Walmart argues that the EEOC isn't acting in Spaeth's \"best interest.\" Stevenson says Spaeth still misses her job.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nalthough galsulfase may not adequately cross the blood  brain barrier, possible beneficial mechanisms include relief of pressure around the optic nerve by reducing dural thickening along the optic canal or reducing scleral thickening at the disc . \n it is possible that galsulfase ert reduced icp by working intravascularly or relieving pressure around the brainstem . \n this case study suggests that earlier galsulfase ert may prevent or decrease optic nerve swelling, atrophy, and blindness in mps vi patients, in the absence of increased icp . \n these findings suggest that mps vi patients who show acute vision changes or optic nerve swelling, as evaluated by specialists in ophthalmology, radiology, and neurosurgery, might benefit from ert with galsulfase, but further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis . \n galsulfase has been found to have an adequate safety profile in clinical trials and is approved by the fda and emea . \n this is the first case of papilledema resolution with improved vision associated with rhasb therapy of mps vi . \n early enzyme - replacement therapy may prevent or decrease optic nerve atrophy resulting in blindness in mps vi patients . \n note to editor : the procedures followed in this clinical case were in accordance with the institutional review board ( irb ) subjected to the united states fda s irb regulations, and the ethical standards of the declaration of helsinki ( 1964 ) of the world medical association ( amended in 1975 and 1983 ) .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nMps vi ( mucopolysaccharidosis vi, known as maroteaux  lamy syndrome ) is a multi - systemic inherited disease, resulting from a deficiency of n - acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, causing accumulation of the glycosaminoglycan ( gag ) dermatan sulfate in all tissues . \n it is one of almost 50 lysosomal storage disorders . \n ocular pathology is common in patients with mps vi, with complications including ocular hypertension, progressive corneal clouding, optic nerve swelling ( or papilledema ) often associated with communicating hydrocephalus ( ashworth et  al ., \n eye 20(5 ), 553563, 2006 ; goldberg et  al ., ajo 69(6 ), 969975 ), and raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) progressing to atrophy with loss of vision ( goodrich et  al ., loss of vision in mps vi is a consequence of increased intracranial pressure, 2002 ) . \n this is the first case report of reversed papilledema and improved visual acuity in an 11-year - old mps vi patient receiving galsulfase ( naglazyme ), an enzyme - replacement therapy ( ert ) of recombinant human arylsulfatase b ( rhasb ) ( harmatz et  al . \n, j pediatr 148(4 ), 533539, 2006 ) .\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAP Images There's a new power couple in Los Angeles. \n \n On Thursday, supermodel Miranda Kerr announced that she's engaged to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel — and to do it, she used Bitmojis from Bitstrips, which Snapchat just bought. \n \n The Australian supermodel started dating the 26-year-old CEO a year ago.

The cost was $5 per eater & whoever ate the most got to keep the entire entry-fee. \n \n The rules were simple; you could not get up during the contest or have anyone help you eat, you did not have to eat the fat & if you got sick, you were out. \n \n The cowboys put in their money,took a seat & the contest was on, steaks were flying. \n \n One of the eaters took the lead by swallowing two steaks in ten minutes. \n \n Next,he politely requested a salad & a shrimp cocktail be served with his third steak. He consumed the extras, then this soft spoken giant called for his fourth steak & ask for a baked potato & a bread roll. He wasted little time on devouring those items & called for his fifth steak. \n \n As the hour contest came to an end, this gastronomic superman had eaten: \n \n 4 & 1/2 pounds of steak, (which is 72 oz’s) baked potato,shrimp cocktail,salad & a bread roll. \n \n In his amazement & delight of the crowd, Owner Bob (RJ) Lee stood up on a chair in the middle of the dinning room to proclaimed that: “from this day forward, anyone who could eat the entire 72 oz dinner-in one hour– gets it for FREE. \n \n On that date in 1962 the legendary 72oz Steak Challenge was born & to this date the contests stands strong. ||||| On Monday, Molly Schuyler ate two 72-ounce steak meals at The Big Texan Steak Ranch. \n \n In less than 15 minutes. \n \n After breakfast. \n \n \"We witnessed history,\" Big Texan co-owner Danny Lee said. \"If there's a zombie apocalypse, I want to stay away from this girl.\" \n \n Schuyler, a competitive eater from Bellevue, Neb., finished her first medium-rare steak in less than 5 minutes to set the record for fastest time to eat the dinner. \n \n She rushed to finish the first steak and the sides, including a baked potato, shrimp, a salad and a bread roll, she said. \n \n \"The second one, I wasn't going really for time,\" she said. \"There was no point.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\ntiming analysis algorithms with the capability of resolving energy dependent properties can be an important tool for probing the physical mechanisms leading to flux variability, such as particle acceleration and cooling @xcite, or the nature of a propagating medium @xcite . in the case of very high energy gamma - ray sources, where high energy processes can be responsible for extreme and short - lived variability events,\nthe observational data are often limited by low photon statistics and non - negligible uncertainty in the reconstructed energy of indivdual events .\nthis makes unbinned methods, which act on the information of the entire available sample, the natural and preferential choice of approach to the temporal analysis of these event lists .\nif the low ( @xmath1 ) and high ( @xmath2 ) energy particles are generated in the same region then they must be able to exist co - spatially .\nthe act of acceleration, or cooling, or moving through a dispersive medium will act to separate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 populations relative to each other .\nan energy dependent correction factor ( @xmath3 ) can be applied to the event arrival times ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the difference in arrival time with and without dispersion, @xmath7 is the energy of the event and @xmath8 is the scale of the correction ( 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc ) . by cycling through a range of correction factors\nwe can determine the one ( @xmath9 ) where the shape of the @xmath2 light - curve best fits that of the @xmath1 one, here we use the kolmogorov distance between the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the event arrival times, as seen in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .\nsimulating 10,000 lightcurves shows the kolmogorov test always has a well defined minimum, with the difference between the expected and best correction ( @xmath10 ) well fit by a gaussian  [ fig : perf ] .\nthe rms of the fit is dependent on the width of the light - curve, but relatively insensitive to the rise and fall times or the number of events contained within, provided there are @xmath11 events in the @xmath2 sample .\nit is also relatively insensitive to the energy binning provided the @xmath12 .\nwe quantify the sensitivity to the burst width by the term sensitivity factor, @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the width of the transient feature in the light - curve . in figure\n[ fig : eres ] we simulated 10,000 gaussian burst profiles of 500 events each and a power - law spectral index of -2.5 .\na dispersion was introduced that varied from 5 - 200% of the burst width .\nwe see, as expected, that the narrower a burst relative to the dispersion the better it can be determined .\nalso plotted in figure  [ fig : eres ] are the results of varying energy resolutions ( @xmath16 ) from ideal ( 0%, 10% and 20% ) .\nthere is a small systematic trend for the reconstructed lag to be underestimated as the energy resolution worsens, again this is to be expected, but this is very small in comparison to the overall statistical error in @xmath9 showing the method is robust to the modest energy resolutions expected in ground based gamma - ray astronomy .\nit is possible to overcome this systematic trend with appropriate monte carlo modelling or bootstrapping, if necessary .     of the algorithm for @xmath17 ( open circle ), @xmath18 ( open square ) and @xmath19 ( open triangle ) energy resolution\nwe have presented a simple method to perform an unbinned, non - parametric energy dependent timing analysis of data with low statistics and moderate energy resolutions .\nfurther details of the performance of the method can be found in @xcite, simulations of current generation vhe gamma - ray instrument observations of agn show the method to be comparable in sensitivity to the more sophisticated analyses which have to make greater assumptions on the instrinsic source physics and instrument response functions .\nthe placing of planck scale limits on the linear term in lorentz invariance violation due to quantum gravity models could be achievable in observations by the next generation instrument cta @xcite .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWe present a method of testing for the presence of energy dependent dispersion in transient features of a light curve . \n it is based on minimising the kolmogorov distance between two cumulative event distribution functions . \n the unbinned and non - parametric nature of the test makes it particularly suitable for searches of statistically limited data sets and we also show that it performs well in the presence of modest energy resolutions typical of gamma -

Wochit \n \n Well, there goes your political life. \n \n A little more than a month after she filed paperwork to create a campaign committee, actress Stacey Dash announced that she was no longer running for Congress. \n \n Dash, a conservative best known for her role as Dionne in Clueless, blamed the political process for her decision to end her run in California's 44th congressional district. The seat is currently held by Democratic freshman Rep. Nanette Barragan. \n \n \"At this point, I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family,\" she said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.\" \n \n Actress Stacey Dash arrives at the \"American Sniper\" premiere at Frederick P.

The 51-year-old, best known for her role as Dionne in Clueless, says she decided not to put her family through the rigors of a political race. \"At this point, I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family,\" she wrote. \"I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.\" Dash would have faced formidable odds. She was running to represent California's 44th District, which includes Compton and Watts and has long been in Democratic hands, notes CNN. Hillary Clinton won the district 83% to 12% over Donald Trump in 2016, and incumbent Nanette Barragán would have been tough to unseat. Dash wrote about her conservative beliefs in a 2016 memoir and had been a contributor to Fox News as an analyst before launching her run. The Washington Post notes that she sometimes courted controversy with statements such as, \"We need to get rid of channels like BET, and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black.”\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nIt's a love story that lasted a lifetime, and beyond. \n \n Don and Maxine Simpson, of Bakersfield, Calif., were married 62 years and died within four hours of each other. \n \n \"It's absolutely beautiful, and the story is beautiful,\" Melissa Sloan, the couple's granddaughter, told ABC affiliate KERO-TV. \n \n The couple met at a bowling alley and were inseparable ever since.

He was extremely short and underweight for his age’. \n \n \n \n He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News . \n \n The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants. \n \n The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit. \n \n Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents. \n \n \n \n After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him. \n \n Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’ \n \n Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school. \n \n The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year. \n \n Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give me a hug and a kiss.”’ \n \n At the time of Joel’s death, it was revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough. \n \n A 'beautiful boy': Joel suffered physical and emotional abuse, and while his mother complained to the Board of Education it did little to alleviate the situation \n \n Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself. \n \n Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR. \n \n \n \n Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died. \n \n \n \n Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.' \n \n The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.' \n \n \n \n In April this year, Rehtaeh Parsons from Nova Scotia, Canada hanged herself after four boys raped her and spread a photograph of the assault, causing classmates and friends to taunt and cyber-bully her, her mother has said. \n \n Driven from school: Joel was taunted by classmates at Public School 102 (pictured) in East Harlem, New York before his family transferred him to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school \n \n Joel's mother Lisbeth Babilonia revealed he always said: 'I love you mum.

Joel Morales was small for his age, smart, and struggled with anxiety disorders, a stutter, and fine motor skill problems, according to the lawsuit. Joel's mother complained to the Department of Education \"multiple times per week\" about the \"severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment\" the boy suffered, but nothing helped, the lawsuit states. After a meeting with school officials and the alleged bullies' parents, the children allegedly snuck into Joel's apartment building to throw sticks and pipes at him; he was then transferred to a different school, but they still followed him after school. Through it all, Joel's mother says, the school didn't discipline anyone. (She also tried, unsuccessfully, to be transferred to a different housing project, Daily Intel reports.)

Parnell was trying to demonstrate that although pitch is so brittle that it'll shatter under a hammer blow, it is actually a liquid at room temperature and will flow and form drops. The only problem was that the drop formation is extremely slow, with eight and nine years passing between the first three drops. \n \n By the time Mainstone joined the University of Queensland faculty in 1961, Parnell's pitch drop demonstration had been relegated to some dusty cupboard. Mainstone convinced the physics department to bring it out and display it. \n \n Mainstone never personally got to see a drop fall, however. Neither did Parnell, nor anybody else in the world. Another pitch-drop experiment at Trinity College Dublin did create a drop this July that the college caught on camera. That demonstration began after the University of Queensland's, in 1944. \n \n Although it takes years to form a drop, it only takes a few seconds for one to fall, and the exact time of the fall is unpredictable. One of Mainstone's drops fell in 2000, but the cameras trained upon it malfunctioned. There's a live camera aimed at the experiment right now. The feed looks eerily like a still photo. \n \n Mainstone got an Ig Nobel in 2005 for \"leading\" the pitch drop experiment, but we're guessing the experiment didn't actually take up any of his time or taxpayer money or anything. (Except for those cameras.) The experiment is a curiosity and a bit of science décor for the University of Queensland. \n \n Mainstone researched the physics of the Earth's atmosphere, Australia's ABC News reports. Before his death, he suffered a stroke and was treated by two cardiologists who had once been his students. \n \n Earlier this year, he said he thought the next drop would fall before the year was out, PhysOrg reports. ||||| This undated photograph released on August 26, 2013 shows John Mainstone (3rd L) with students examining the world's longest running laboratory test, the Pitch Drop Experiment. Mainstone died last week after overseeing the experiment for over half a century. The science professor who oversaw the world's longest running laboratory test—the Pitch Drop Experiment—has died after more than half a century on its watch, his university said Monday. \n \n John Mainstone, the former head of the Department of Physics at the University of Queensland, was in charge of the experiment which demonstrated the fluidity and viscosity of pitch, a tar derivative once used to waterproof boats. \n \n The experiment, established in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell, was designed to show that pitch, although it feels solid and can be shattered by a hammer blow at room temperature, acts like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time. \n \n It took three years for the pitch to settle and then the glass funnel holding the substance was cut to allow it to flow out. \n \n In the 83 years since then, only eight drops of pitch have fallen and no one has seen one actually fall, the university said. \n \n Earlier this year Mainstone, who died last week aged 78 after suffering a stroke, said it looked like the next drop would fall before the end of 2013. \n \n \"It's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop,\" the professor, who had monitored the tar's glacial movements for 52 years, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \n \n The head of the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queensland University Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, said Mainstone would be greatly missed. \n \n \"Professor Mainstone's dedication to the long-running experiment well past his official retirement ensured that media, researchers and undergraduate students had easy access to relevant information and an understanding of the important science behind it,\" she said. \n \n \"John's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment, he did not see a single drop fall,\" she added. \n \n The experiment is under constant surveillance, with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop's fall on camera. \n \n Explore further: Through the looking glass: physicists solve age-old problem\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nLast month we wrote about the pitch-drop experiment, which is meant to demonstrate the concept that pitch (a tar derivative) is actually a high-viscosity substance, meaning it appears solid but is actually slowly flowing. An experiment to prove just that has been running in Brisbane since 1927—and now comes the news that the scientist who has headed the experiment since 1961 died last week without ever seeing it drop. He was 78. John Mainstone was actually responsible for resurrecting the experiment, which had \"been relegated to some dusty cupboard\" at the University of Queensland, reports Popular Science. As the \"custodian of the world's longest-running science experiment,\" drops did fall on his watch—eight have done so since its start—but Mainstone was never present for one. Two sad misses: Mainstone failed to capture a 2000 drop because the camera trained on it faltered; PhysOrg reports that he expected the ninth drop to fall this year. (You can monitor it here.) Though Mainstone retired in 1996, the Australian notes that he kept an office at the school and continued in his \"custodian\" role. He was awarded an Ig Nobel in 2005. (A similar experiment running in Dublin since 1944 finally captured a drop; see it here.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

But most legal scholars — and even leaders of the president's own party — are skeptical. \n \n In an interview with Axios, published Tuesday, the president said he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to noncitizens. \n \n \"You can definitely do it with an act of Congress,\" Trump said in the Axios interview. \"But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.\" \n \n Trump may have a lawyer who is telling him the 14th Amendment means something else, but that lawyer is like a unicorn. \n \n The 14th Amendment holds that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Most legal scholars take that as an explicit protection of birthright citizenship — and think it will take much more than an executive order to change that. \n \n \"Trump may have a lawyer who is telling him the 14th Amendment means something else, but that lawyer is like a unicorn,\" said Rebecca Hamlin, a professor of legal studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \n \n Trump's proposal seems to rely on the work of a small but vocal group of conservative legal scholars who argue the 14th Amendment has long been misread. In particular, they argue, five key words — \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" — have been misread and that the authors of the 14th Amendment did not intend to give citizenship to the children of temporary visitors and other noncitizens. \n \n \"We've got this notion that just kind of developed over the last 40 or 50 years that is completely without any sort of legal authority,\" said John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute. \n \n Most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this debate more than a century ago, holding that \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" refers to anyone present in the U.S., except for the children of diplomats and enemy soldiers (and, at the time, Native Americans). \n \n \"I think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument,\" said Margaret Stock, an attorney at the Cascadia Cross-Border Law Group in Anchorage, Alaska, and a former law professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. \"I've been debating folks like this for more than a decade, and they claim that the 14th Amendment's been misinterpreted,\" she said. \"And now they've got a president in office who apparently was fixated on this as well.\" \n \n Trump's critics say the proposal's timing — just a week before the midterm elections — suggests that it is intended to motivate his political base. \n \n \"This is about getting the base worked up before the midterms,\" Hamlin said. \"He may not ever even issue the executive order that he floated in the Axios interview.\" \n \n Even Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, thinks the president's proposal is unlikely to succeed. \n \n \"You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,\" Ryan said Tuesday in an interview with Kentucky radio station WVLK. \n \n \"You know as a conservative, I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution,\" Ryan added. \"And I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.\" ||||| President Trump really, really wants to make the midterm election about immigration, and for a while it looked like he had an edge due to Democratic excess. But with this week’s pre-election vow to end birthright citizenship in America by executive order, Mr. Trump has driven into his own constitutional ditch. \n \n Mr. Trump has the political high ground as long as he is trying to stop lawlessness or deter migrant caravans mobilized by left-wing groups in Central America. Even deploying soldiers to the border in nonmilitary roles...\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWhether President Trump can end birthright citizenship with an executive order comes down to one's reading of the 14th Amendment. As NPR explains in a fact-check piece, a \"small but vocal group of conservative legal scholars\" have zeroed in on five crucial words, bolded here: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Those scholars say those words have been misinterpreted and that the authors' true intention was that citizenship not be extended to the children of noncitizens. More: The Wall Street Journal's editorial board agrees with NPR's take and gives more historical background, writing \"'jurisdiction' is well understood as referring to the territory where the force of law applies, and that means it applies to nearly everyone on US soil. The exceptions in 1868 were diplomats (who have sovereign immunity) and Native Americans on tribal lands. Congress later granted Native Americans birth citizenship while diminishing tribal sovereignty.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\n“The elite media got it dead wrong, 100 percent dead wrong,” Mr. Bannon said of the election, calling it “a humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there.” \n \n “The mainstream media has not fired or terminated anyone associated with following our campaign,” Mr. Bannon said. “Look at the Twitter feeds of those people: They were outright activists of the Clinton campaign.” (He did not name specific reporters or editors.) \n \n “That’s why you have no power,” he added. “You were humiliated.” \n \n Mr. Bannon spoke in blunt but calm tones, peppered with profanity, and humorously referred to himself as “Darth Vader.” He said, with ironic relish, that Mr. Trump was elected by a surge of support from “the working-class hobbits and deplorables.” \n \n The conversation was initiated by Mr. Bannon to offer praise for Mr. Spicer, who has been criticized this week for making false claims at the White House podium about attendance at Mr. Trump’s inaugural, for calling reporters dishonest and lecturing them about what stories to write, and for failing to disavow Mr. Trump’s lie about widespread voter fraud in the election. \n \n Asked if he was concerned that Mr. Spicer had lost credibility with the news media, Mr. Bannon chortled. “Are you kidding me?” he said. “We think that’s a badge of honor. ‘Questioning his integrity’ — are you kidding me?

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nUpdate: iOS 10.2 has been released. \n \n Apple today released a developer preview of iOS 10.2 which includes favorites such as the Shrug and Fingers Crossed emojis for the first time. \n \n \n \n Above: No more waiting. Shrug is included in iOS 10.2 developer beta. \n \n Other popular additions coming in this iOS update include Fox Face, Avocado, and Owl. \n \n iOS 10.2 developer beta adds full Unicode 9 emoji support which includes all of the following 72 emojis approved in June 2016: \n \n There are so many popular additions in this set that there is likely to be something for everyone. In particular, these tend to rank highly on Emojipedia: \n \n As with any iOS emoji update, users may take a while to find where the new emojis are, as they are interspersed throughout the keyboard: \n \n \n \n Above: New Animals in iOS 10.2 include Fox, Duck, Squid, Gorilla. \n \n In addition to Unicode 9 support, new emoji professions from the Emoji 4.0 update are included in this new release. \n \n These include roles such as Firefighter and Judge, with female and male versions of each (in all skin tones). \n \n \n \n Above: Female Firefighter and Female Judge are available in iOS 10.2. \n \n In total 16 new professions are supported, which appear as 32 emojis on the keyboard — one female, one male. Times that by six skin tone options, and this list of 16 jobs becomes 192 distinct images. \n \n Here they are, all the new emoji professions: \n \n \n \n Above: A range of professions on the emoji keyboard in iOS 10.2. \n \n Apple's previous emoji release was iOS 10 in September 2016, which included new emoji artwork, gendered emojis, and a change to the gun emoji. \n \n \n \n Above: Female versions of existing emojis were added in iOS 10. \n \n Changes \n \n In addition to all the new emojis, Apple has also updated the appearance of all remaining emojis not changed in the last revision. \n \n \n \n Above: Brand new emoji designs in iOS 10.2. \n \n The new art style is more bulbous, with sharp details which are beautiful. While it's a shame to lose some of the hand crafted details of the original set, this new 3D-style set looks like a cohesive collection for the first time. \n \n It's clear this was a large project, which must have taken considerable time. Kudos to those involved with this. \n \n Overall, these image updates are a welcome addition given the ad-hoc nature of emoji updates over the years! \n \n Release \n \n A public release date is not yet known for iOS 10.2, but given a normal release cycle this is likely to hit phones in November 2016. \n \n Given the nature of beta releases, it is possible that some of the emoji artwork could still change prior to the final release. \n \n We originally speculated these updates would have arrived in iOS 10.1 earlier this month, so we got it wrong on that front: \n \n 👏 Expect two major iOS emoji updates in 2016 �? \n \n \n \n 🗓 iOS 10.0: Gendered Roles + Redesign \n \n 🗓 iOS 10.1: Professions + Unicode 9 — Emojipedia 📙 (@Emojipedia) August 26, 2016 \n \n Related \n \n If you missed them, see what was new in the past two emoji updates from Apple: \n \n Lastly, here's a look at what is sure to become a popular emoji around the web very quickly: \n \n \n \n Above: Face Palm will be very popular. There is no doubt. \n \n Don't Miss Out \n \n We can't all spend our days here on Emojipedia.

Along with numerous new animals and foods, the update will include new gestures including face palm, fingers crossed and selfie (which is an eerie disembodied arm holding a phone). The latest emoji update arrives not long after the Museum of Modern Art in New York announced that it had added the original set of 176 emoji to its permanent collection. \n \n \n \n As for the Aladin Sane-inspired emoji, the design is among the more unique tributes to Bowie, who died in January after a long battle with cancer he largely kept secret. Just days before his death, Bowie released his final album, Blackstar, though three of his final recordings recently appeared on the cast album for his musical, Lazarus.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nNext time ground control wants to get in touch with Major Tom, it can just text an emoji. According to Emojipedia, the new batch of emojis being released with iOS 10.2 will include—along with a face palm, a shrug, crossed fingers, and more—a singer with a lightning bolt painted over his or her eye. Rolling Stone notes the emoji is an obvious riff on David Bowie's look from the Aladdin Sane album cover. The magazine says the singer emoji is \"among the more unique tributes to Bowie.\" The legendary musician died last January from cancer.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\narticle \n \n While the law-school dean is denying a link between the Sandusky scandal and an email sent to prospective students Wednesday offering to waive the standard $60 application fee, recipients are mocking the timing. \n \n Prospective law-school students received a curious email Wednesday afternoon from the dean of admissions at Penn State’s School of Law. \n \n “Congratulations,” the subject line reads. “Your application fee has been waived.” \n \n “We know you have a lot to think about right now and we hope that Penn State Law is among the top law schools you are considering,” Amanda DiPolvere wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Beast. Addressing the media frenzy surrounding former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky since a Nov. 4 grand-jury report detailed alleged child sex abuse, she added, “No doubt you have seen recent headlines regarding Penn State University.” \n \n “Penn State’s new president is dedicated to restoring the trust of all people Penn State serves and to a renewed focus on Penn State’s status as one of the world’s preeminent research universities,” she wrote. \n \n Then DiPolvere, whose admissions office last year received more than 5,300 applications, many paying a “$60 nonrefundable application fee,” offered up a carrot for prospective students: “To make it easier for you to apply, we have waived your application fee.” \n \n The reaction among potential applicants, at least those who took to social media to share their feelings, was swift. \n \n “Hahahaha Penn State just sent me a fee waiver to apply to their law school,” one recipient wrote of the letter, adding a thinly veiled hashtag for the school as her answer: “#nothappening.” \n \n Another noted the timing of the letter. “Dear Penn State,” @miss_kGa tweeted, “while I appreciate the law school fee waiver, y’all should probably wait a few days before sending more out. #badtiming” \n \n A third tweeted, “Just got an email from Penn State encouraging me to apply to their law school and giving me an application waver. HAHA. gotta be kidding me.” \n \n The sentiment expressed by the prospective students underscores an ongoing challenge for Penn State, which is hoping to clear its reputation after accusations of a series of mishaps and inaction at the highest executive level in the Sandusky case. \n \n “Obviously the PSU email caught my eye with the scandal being such a current public affair,” said Derek Atwood, a senior at the University of Saint Francis in Fort Wayne, Ind. “Some of the schools that have contacted me have extended application waivers, but I would say that PSU is one of the more prominent universities to do so.” \n \n “This waiver, considering the included email, definitely seems to be a response to the allegations,” he added. \n \n But DiPolvere, who sent the email on behalf of the school, denied that its timing was affected by the scandal. “Our solicitation and fee waiver reflect our standard practice in attempting to recruit applicants within a certain range of LSAT scores,” she told The Daily Beast. “The solicitation is timed to arrive shortly after potential applicants receive the results of the October administration of the LSAT. Because this standard timing practice occurred this year in such close proximity to the recent allegations regarding some Penn State personnel, we thought it best to include reference to the publicity and a statement reflecting our law school’s reaction.” \n \n In recent days, the Penn State community has struggled to cope with the unraveling of the university’s executive management team and the firing of beloved football coach Joe Paterno. “This is like 9/11 for Happy Valley,” Ben Novak, a former member of the Penn State board of trustees, told The Daily Beast last week. “It will affect the community’s consciousness for years.” \n \n In addition to ousting Paterno, the university has dismissed President Graham Spanier and placed Mike McQueary—the graduate student turned assistant coach who said he witnessed one of the Sandusky incidents but failed to call police—on indefinite leave. Experts say the sex-abuse allegations will likely threaten the university’s “rising financial and academic standing” for some time. The school has reportedly enlisted Ketchum for its crisis communications, and is already benefiting from \"a few team members\" on the ground at Penn State. \n \n \n \n But all’s not lost for Penn State Law, at least when it comes to one of Dean DiPolvere’s email recipients. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Applicants aren’t so sure. The Daily Beast recounts the similar responses of two email recipients: \"Just got an email from Penn State encouraging me to apply to their law school and giving me an application waver.

But one hopped-up rabbit's less-than-legal alternative actually ended up turning him into an unwitting crime fighter. \n \n An illustration of how the rabbit might have looked. Note the telltale red eyes. Wikipedia \n \n Last week, the big-eared pet, named Pinpon, helped lead authorities to an abandoned house containing marijuana plants in the village of Huaura, Peru. As multiple local news outlets are reporting, however, his actions weren't so pure. \n \n Turns out, the illicit pot-grow operation was only discovered because Pinpon was helping himself to the supply. \n \n According to the rabbit's young owner, Pinpon had escaped from home repeatedly — only to arrive back later in suspiciously higher spirits. \n \n \"My rabbit was on the other side of my house, at an abandoned place, and after he returned more playful,\" she told Panamaricana. Her curiosity piqued, she decided to follow Pinpon the next time he escaped. And sure enough, he just couldn't help himself. \n \n \"He went back later and I found him eating a plant,\" she said. \n \n At first, Pinpon's owner thought it might be a rare plant native to the region, so she told her family about it. After somebody ventured over to check it out, they discovered it was actually weed. \n \n That's when the cops were called. \n \n Apparently, the rabbit was none too pleased to have his secret stash uncovered. He is said to have run away briefly after the bust, but has since decided to return home. \n \n Still, the whole odd tale has had one last effect; it's made him a local celebrity of sorts, giving rise to 'lazy stoner rabbit' memes like this one: \n \n \"I cannot stand seeing the house dirty... now let me get up to turn off the light.\" \n \n \n \n Jokes aside — we hope little Pinpon will go on to live a happy drug-free life, sticking to the less potent greens bunnies like him are suppose to enjoy.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nOne girl's pet bunny in Huaura, Peru, apparently had a hard time playing it cool when he stumbled onto a secret marijuana stash in a neighboring home; he seemed suspiciously frisky every time he returned from his recurring escape. So she took it upon herself to follow her little Pinpon, only to discover that the abandoned house on the other side of her own was housing plants that her pet felt compelled to munch on, Yahoo News reports she told Panamaricana. The innocent girl told the family about the plants she had discovered; they investigated with more mature eyes and called the police. After the authorities came and removed the potted plants, Pinpon is rumored to have run away (in one last ditch effort to find the weed?) but has now retired back to his previously sober life at home, reports the Dodo. But now he's become a local celebrity of sorts, and has even inspired his own meme on Facebook. Police took the plants; there's no word on whether the grower was found. (Pinpon may have been nibbling his weed for free, but in the US it costs the average legal user hundreds a year.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nwe report herein a case of melanotic or pigmented choroid plexus carcinoma in the posterior fossa of an 11-year - old female . \n a histopathological study supported by immunohistochemistry helped the authors to diagnose this rare entity . how to differentiate this tumor from pigmented papillary medulloblastoma, cerebellar papillary ependymoma, and metastatic malignant melanoma is discussed . \n the pigmented or melanotic variant of choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) is very rarely encountered ;

The area is known for big storm activity, but waves had been previously difficult to measure. \n \n Bigger waves possible \n \n The \"eight-storey high\" wave was generated by a deep low pressure system and 65-knot winds, said MetService senior oceanographer Dr Tom Durrant. \n \n \"This is a very exciting event and to our knowledge it is the largest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere,\" he told the BBC. \n \n The buoy operates for 20 minutes every three hours. Dr Durrant said it was possible that even bigger waves were generated by the storm but not recorded. \n \n The World Meteorological Organization does not hold official records on individual wave heights. Instead, it records an average of successive swells - a measure known as the \"significant wave height\". \n \n During the storm recorded by New Zealand, the significant wave height was 14.9m. \n \n That is a record for the Southern Ocean but below a 19m mark measured by a buoy in the North Atlantic in 2016, Dr Durrant said. \n \n He said storms moved across the Southern Ocean largely unhindered due to a lack of land. \n \n \"[It is] the engine room for generating swell waves that then propagate throughout the planet,\" he said. \n \n \"Indeed surfers in California can expect energy from this storm to arrive at their shores in about a week's time.\" ||||| A solitary buoy in the remote Southern Ocean has recorded a monster wave of 23.8 metres, the largest wave ever measured in the southern hemisphere. \n \n A wave rider buoy moored at Campbell Island off New Zealand's South Island registered the huge wave on Tuesday, according to Tom Durrant, a senior oceanographer at Metocean, part of Meteorological Metservice of New Zealand (MetService). \n \n The biggest wave ever recorded in the southern hemisphere was measured this week off New Zealand. Photo: MetOcean \n \n Since the buoy only registered the first 20 minutes of each three hours, \"it's quite possible, even probable, that there were much higher waves during this storm\", Dr Durrant said. \n \n It eclipsed the previous record maximum individual 22.03 metres clocked at an Australian buoy south of Tasmania in 2012. \n \n The so-called significant wave height for the event, which is an average of the top third of waves measured from their crest to trough, was registered at 14.9 metres.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe northern hemisphere still has it beat, but the southern hemisphere can now claim a new record when it comes to tallest wave. A solar-powered buoy placed near New Zealand's Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean on Tuesday recorded an eight-story wave that measured 78 feet in height, beating out the 72-foot wave recorded south of Tasmania in 2012. Tom Durrant, an oceanographer with the Meteorological Service of New Zealand, tells the BBC the Southern Ocean is \"the engine room for generating swell waves that then propagate throughout the planet. Indeed surfers in California can expect energy from this storm to arrive at their shores in about a week's time.\" And as far as the Southern Ocean goes, it's \"definitely the most under-observed ocean in the world,\" he tells the Sydney Morning Herald. The buoy has been in place since March in order to observe the extreme conditions that can occur there, and Durrant notes that to preserve its battery life it only keeps records for one 20-minute span out of every three hours. That, combined with the fact the buoy wasn't perfectly positioned during the storm, means it's \"probable\" a bigger wave actually occurred, reports the South China Morning Post. (The tallest wave recorded took place in Alaska's Lituya Bay in 1958.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Christie was asked by a passerby why he didn't merge a township and a borough during his eight years in office. \n \n \"Well, as governor, I can't. I can't. I don't have the authority to do it,\" he said with his wife, Mary Pat, smiling behind him. \n \n After voting, Christie got into a bit of an argument with a voter who questioned why he didn't merge His two towns pic.twitter.com/n3AQi3PfBk — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017 \n \n \"Go in and vote for whoever you want.

It's easier to sit here and complain.\" \n \n Read More ||||| The day is finally upon fellow New Jerseyans to elect a new governor to succeed Chris Christie and put an end to a truly interesting and bombastic era. And as a last hurrah before his term ends in January, the much-hated governor decided to end things in the most typical fashion he could pull off: getting into a spat with a voter outside the polls on Tuesday. \n \n On Tuesday, Christie chatted with reporters outside his local polling site and was chastised by an unidentified woman, who aired her grievances to him. \n \n \"You’re so frustrated and you know what the easiest thing in the world, the easiest thing in the world is to stand where you stand and stand on the sidelines and critique,\" Christie snapped at the woman, who wanted to know why a local township and borough hadn't been consolidated. \"Go in and vote for whatever you want, I never said I was going to merge the two towns.\" \n \n After voting, Christie got into a bit of an argument with a voter who questioned why he didn't merge His two towns pic.twitter.com/n3AQi3PfBk — Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) November 7, 2017 \n \n The video was uploaded to Twitter by New York Times reporter, Nick Corasaniti. \n \n The consolidation of New Jersey's 565 municipalities has been a contentious issue in the state for the last few years, but little progress has been made. In 2013, Christie strongly supported the merging of Mendham Borough and Mendham Township, where he resided.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nChris Christie still has a couple more months as governor of New Jersey, but on the day his eventual successor was elected, Christie offered what Salon calls a pretty fitting goodbye to voters in his state. While chatting with reporters outside his local polling site Tuesday, Christie was approached by a woman upset he didn't merge a borough and a township (the township where Christie himself resides), CNN reports. \"You want to merge Mendham Township and Mendham Borough, run for the township committee,\" the governor said in the video shot by New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti. \"No, I know, 'cause that's too hard.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Renowned financier and philanthropist David Rubenstein travels the country talking to leaders to uncover their stories and their path to success. The first episode of season two features Oprah Winfrey. The interview taped Dec. 12. (Source: Bloomberg) ||||| Oprah Winfrey has a message for anyone still undecided about the presidential election: Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is the only reasonable choice ― even if you dislike her. \n \n “There really is no choice, people,” Winfrey told T.D. Jakes during an interview on his namesake show on Winfrey’s OWN network. The full interview is set to air next week. \n \n “All the people sitting around talking about they can’t decide ... this is what I really want to say,” Winfrey said. “I hear this all the time, you get in conversations ... where people say, ‘I just don’t know if I like her.’ She’s not coming over to your house. You don’t have to like her. You don’t have to like her.” \n \n Winfrey suggested there are much bigger questions voters should be asking themselves about this election. \n \n “Do you like this country?” Winfrey asked. “You better get out there and vote. Do you like the country? Do you like freedom and liberty? Do you like Democracy? Or do you want a demagogue?” \n \n Winfrey didn’t mention Republican nominee Donald Trump by name. \n \n Trump is the most unpopular major-party presidential nominee in modern U.S. history. Clinton also has struggled with likability among voters. \n \n Winfrey, who endorsed Clinton earlier this year, hasn’t been an outspoken advocate for the Democratic nominee. She told Jakes that’s largely due to the unusually unpleasant campaign. \n \n “The reason why I haven’t been vocal other than saying, ‘I’m with her,’” Winfrey said, “is because I didn’t know what I could say that could actually pierce through all the noise, and the chaos, and the disgusting vitriol that is going on, and actually be heard.” ||||| UPDATED 3/2: After Oprah Winfrey joked that she wasn’t ruling out a presidential run, her close friend Gayle King weighed in Thursday on CBS This Morning to say that it was most likely just that — a joke. \n \n “You always have the right to change your mind but I would bet my first, second born and any unborn children to come, that ain’t never happening,” she said. “Never. I’ll say never on this one.” \n \n ORIGINAL: Oprah Winfrey said that she is not so dismissive of the idea of running for president. \n \n In an interview with Bloomberg Media’s David Rubenstein, Winfrey said that she “never considered the question, even the possibility. I just thought, ‘Oh. Oh.'” \n \n Rubenstein then referred to Trump’s election, as he is the first figure to ascend to the presidency with no government and military experience. \n \n Winfrey said, “I thought, ‘I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough.’ And now I am thinking, ‘Oh.'” \n \n It is unclear just how serious she was. \n \n Winfrey did get involved in the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, holding fundraisers for his candidacy and, in 2007 and 2008, appearing at rallies in Iowa, South Carolina and California. One study showed that Winfrey’s endorsement of Obama generated a “statistically and qualitatively significant increase” in votes for him in the Democratic primary. \n \n Winfrey backed Hillary Clinton in the most recent presidential election, but she did not campaign for her.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAn #Oprah2020 hashtag popped up on Twitter Wednesday, and it wasn't spurred by some random liberal pipe dream, but by the person the Daily Beast describes as our \"national darling.\" In an interview with Carlyle Group CEO David Rubenstein for his Bloomberg Television talk show, Winfrey said she'd never seriously considered a run because she has no government experience. But then Donald Trump came along and moved into the Oval Office, a fact that Winfrey says has made her rethink her original assessment. \"I thought, 'Oh gee, I don't have the experience, I don't know enough.' … And now I'm thinking—oh,\" she told Rubenstein, who added \"it's clear\" that a resume packed with government know-how is no longer required for the job. Variety reports that what wasn't clear was Oprah's seriousness on the matter, though it notes she was an active participant in Barack Obama's two presidential runs, taking part in fundraisers and rallies. She was also a Hillary Clinton supporter, though she said in October she didn't make more noise on that front because she didn't think anyone would hear her over all of the \"disgusting vitriol,\" per the Huffington Post. (Oprah recently shared why she never had kids.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

old boy presented with a 6-month history of left - hand dystonia . \n six months previously the patient had experienced the sudden onset of involuntary twitching movement on the left hand . since then the patient developed abnormal cramping whenever he played the piano or a computer game . during the subsequent months, \n this involuntary movement progressed to occur in all other activities during wakefulness, but disappeared during sleep . \n he had never been taken any neuroleptic or dopaminergic drugs, and there was no family history of neurological diseases . \n a neurological examination was normal except for the dystonia of the left hand, which consisted of abduction and extension of the fingers and flexion of the wrist ( fig . \n the dystonia appeared both at rest and during voluntary movements, but was aggravated by actions such as spreading out his fingers or playing the piano . \n the results of our routine investigations, including hematological and biochemical screening, and measurements of the serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, were all normal . \n magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain showed an ill - defined mass lesion in the right basal ganglia, especially involving the putamen, globus pallidus, head of caudate, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule ( fig . \n 2 ) . positron - emission tomography using f - deoxyglucose demonstrated diffuse hypometabolism in the right basal ganglia, right thalamus, and adjacent insular and temporal cortices ( fig . \n the histopathological examination showed characteristic features of pure germinoma, and immunohistochemical staining using plap ( placental alkaline phosphatase ) was positive ( fig . \n cns germinoma is a malignant germ cell tumor that is mostly found in the pineal region and hypothalamic area . \n other uncommon cerebral locations of germinoma include the basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, posterior fossa, fourth ventricle, cerebellopontine angle, medulla oblongata, and cerebral hemispheres.3 - 8 this tumor mostly arises in children and young adults . \n we present a unique case of a 9-year - old boy with a right basal ganglia germinoma presenting with focal hand dystonia . \n a radiological examination prompted various possible diagnoses, such as low - grade astrocytoma, lymphoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or germ cell tumor . \n clinical observations of symptomatic dystonia have led to suggestions that focal hand dystonia is related to lesions of the posterolateral thalamic nuclei and, more rarely, of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and parietal cortex,9,10 whereas hemidystonia has been related to large caudatocapsulolenticular lesions and small lesions in the putamen.9 - 12 because of the variable location of lesions causing focal dystonia, marsden et al . \n and pettigrew and jankovic suggested that symptomatic dystonia is produced by abnormal thalamicmediated input to the premotor cortex and ultimately the motor cortex from the basal ganglia.9,12 this inappropriate information delivered to the premotor area can be produced by a lesion anywhere in the striatopallidothalamic connections to the premotor cortex . \n dystonia therefore may be viewed as a consequence of the release of premotor cortical activity from thalamic control.9 - 12 our patient experienced focal hand dystonia associated with a germinoma involving the putamen, globus pallidus, head of caudate, and the anterior limb of    internal capsule . \n however, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying why dystonia was largely restricted to one limb in our patient remains unclear . \n a possible explanation is the presence of a somatotopic representation of the foot, hand, and face within the basal ganglia . \n recent functional neuroimaging and clinicoradiological studies suggest the presence of a somatotopic organization of the putamen, but precise characterization of this has not been possible.13 - 15 in conclusion, cns germinoma in the basal ganglia is very rare, and combining its anatomical and clinical presentation in our patient with data in the literature suggests that the focal hand dystonia can result from disruption of the pathways within and adjacent to the basal ganglia .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nDescriptions of symptomatic focal dystonia caused by focal lesions of the central nervous system ( cns ) are rare in the literature . \n we report a 9-year -

These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nFriends say surprise reconciliation is on the cards after Hollywood couple embrace affectionately at first meeting since break-up \n \n Back on?: Tweets hint Ashton and Demi may be reconciling \n \n Demi Moore and Ashton ­Kutcher could be on course for a sensational reconciliation. \n \n The glamorous couple, whose break-up shocked Hollywood, have put their divorce plans on ice. \n \n They met for the first time this week since Demi, 49, dumped her husband of six years and went into rehab after claims that he had cheated. \n \n The pair were locked in a 60-second embrace at the birthday party of the man who officiated at their wedding and friends are sure their feelings for each other are as strong as ever. \n \n A source told the Sunday Mirror: “They are still desperately in love and could be on for a reconciliation. The divorce isn’t being processed right now.” \n \n Demi had been laying down hints all week on Twitter that she could be ready to forgive and start from scratch. \n \n Eyevine Loving embrace: Ashton and Demi, seen here before the split, embraced at a private party \n \n And Ashton, 34, had tears in his eyes as he made a speech at the party, declaring: “I’ve made all these horrendous mistakes in the last year.” \n \n A guest at the 40th birthday bash for Kaballah Rabbi Yehuda Berg said: “Ashton’s voice started to break as he spoke. He just fell into tears. He sat down to a round of applause while Demi just looked ­frozen.” \n \n Ashton had arrived at the InterContinental Hotel in Beverly Hills two hours before Indecent Proposal star Demi. \n \n A guest said: “Ashton was there quietly socialising and Demi showed up a couple of hours later looking amazing. \n \n “She went over to wish Yehuda a happy birthday and Ashton was right by him. Yehuda left them to talk. They started to chat and were extremely affectionate. She was ­staring at him like a love-sick puppy.” \n \n The witness added: “They both sat at the front with a mutual friend between them. Demi got up to speak and spoke about family not necessarily being your blood but being people who love you. \n \n “Then Ashton got up and he spoke about how amazing Yehuda was. \n \n \"He said that if Yehuda is your friend, he’ll love you unconditionally, no ­matter what mistakes you’ve made, before making the emotional admission that he had made mistakes. It was obvious he was referring to the break-up.” \n \n Earlier Demi had “favourited” a tweet from singer Wiz Khalifa saying: “We all make mistakes. Don’t let that be the reason you give up on somebody.” \n \n Another tweet Demi made a favourite was from a daily quotation service called The Love Stories which said: “Sometimes you have to love people from a distance and give them space and time to get their minds right.” \n \n Meanwhile, Ashton has been ­spending time with Demi’s daughter Rumer, 23. They were seen at an LA Lakers basketball game before having drinks together at a hotel. \n \n Want to see which celebrity pair got back together and are now getting MARRIED?

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\na 28-year -

up . \n she presented 6 months later, with an increase in the left eye proptosis ( an increase of 6 mm of proptosis ), no light perception in the left eye and a left afferent pupillary defect [ fig . \n restriction of extraocular movements was present in all gazes . given the rapid progression of the lesion, that is uncharacteristic of a typical meningioma and the absence of other signs of meningioma ( absent optociliary shunt vessels, no tram track sign on imaging ) the preliminary diagnosis was doubted and surgical exploration was planned . \n histopathologically, biopsy of the mass was interpreted as malignant melanoma, showing epithelioid cells arranged in sheets with marked pigmentation . \n a metastatic workup including a thorough dermatological assessment, ct head, chest x - ray, abdominal ultrasound and liver function test was negative . ultrasound examination of the right eye did not show any uveal or choroidal mass . \n lid sparing exenteration was done, histopathology of which was confirmatory of an orbital melanoma with no involvement of the optic nerve head or juxtapapillary choroid, infiltrating the sclera, and the extraocular muscles . \n oval to spindle shaped cells with prominent nucleoli and marked cytoplasmic pigmentation were seen arranged in fascicles and nests with interspersed mitosis [ figs . 3 and 4 ] . \n hyperdense lesion with calcification involving retrobulbar, intraconal compartment and encircling the optic nerve in left orbit on axial and sagittal computed tomography scan left eye proptosis with left afferent pupillary defect sheet of oval to spindle pigmented cells with pleomorphism, interspersed necrosis and angiogenesis ( h and e, 200 ) irregular islands of infiltrating melanoma cells . \n vague pseudo glandular pattern also seen ( h and e, 200 ) she presented 20 months later with a pigmented growth on the left lateral orbital rim . \n ct scan showed heterogeneously enhancing mass extending into the left infratemporal fossa measuring 2.3 cm  1.9 cm . \n the patient was treated with local radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy ( dacarbazine 300 mg with cisplatin 70 mg for six cycles ) . \n they are thought to represent metastasis from an unknown primary or to arise from ectopic melanocytes ( nevus of ota or blue nevus ) . \n if there is no evidence of ocular melanocytosis, and no demonstrable primary melanoma elsewhere, the lesion can be classified as a presumed de novo pom . \n however, it may present as orbital varix, orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, eyelash poliosis, meningioma, or an orbital vascular anomaly . \n although calcification is encountered in cases of intraocular melanoma postdestructive therapeutic interventions, spontaneous calcification is very rare . \n only three cases of spontaneous calcification in intraocular melanoma have been reported in the literature . \n spontaneous calcification in an orbital melanoma is rarer still with only one case being reported in the literature by froula et al . in our case, there was no clinical or histopathological evidence of any melanocytoma, choroidal melanoma, nevus of ota or blue nevus . \n the ct appearance showed calcification in a mass surrounding the optic nerve, which led to the radiological diagnosis of a meningioma . with this presentation, \n treatment was delayed as the patient refused surgery on learning about the slow growing nature of the suspected diagnosis ( optic nerve sheath meningioma ) . \n no distant focus of melanoma evolved during this duration, giving credence to the de novo origin of the orbital melanoma . to conclude, orbital melanoma although rare should be considered as a differential diagnosis in an orbital mass presenting with calcification . \n a suspected optic nerve sheath meningioma with a rapid growth phase should be viewed with suspicion and an alternative diagnosis may be considered .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPrimary orbital melanoma is rare and has varied initial presentation . a 28-year -

The former No. 88's struggles led to the creation of the \"88 Plan\" to aid former players suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDescription \n \n Do you need a larger size than what’s being offered in this image?

They surround themselves with the strength and wisdom of talented and experienced people, but as Harry Truman once said, The buck stops here. We can hardly imagine the weight of decisions they must bear. Perhaps that is why we are so familiar with the before and after photographs depicting the accelerated aging process while in office. These leaders deserve some time to relax and unwind. \n \n Some of the greatest times anyone can enjoy are when we can let our guard down because we are among those who have been where we have been: people who know the truth and don’t make harsh judgments. We can have a great time with each other especially after the challenge has been met and the heat is off. We can talk, commiserate and just be ourselves. \n \n Who do former presidents hang out with? Wouldn’t it be just a great time if they could let their hair down together and just have time to laugh and remember?

It's a print hanging in his office called \"The Republican Club\" that depicts Trump fraternizing with other US presidents including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Abe Lincoln in a private club, the Daily Beast reports. The framed image was apparently a gift from Rep. Darrell Issa—or so says Andy Thomas, the artist, who tells the Washington Post he was thrilled to receive a complimentary phone call from Trump a couple of weeks ago. \"I remember he said he's seen a lot of paintings of himself and he doesn't usually like them,\" says Thomas. \"He liked that one.\" Thomas adds with a laugh, \"I hung up and said, 'I'm too good to go out and finish mowing the lawn.'\" Thomas mostly paints Western scenes (\"cowboys and Indians,\" he says) but has a thing for group-presidential portraits that sell in gift shops—like \"The Republican Club,\" a print of Democratic presidents playing poker, and one of Republicans playing pool. He says little of his own politics (\"I challenge people to look at the paintings and see if they can figure it out\") but admits he idealized Trump's appearance a little: \"...[I] try to shed the pounds where I need to,\" he says. \"Or smooth some lines. I did it with every figure.\" Critics are calling the work \"kitschy\" and \"garish,\" notes ArtNet, while one Twitter user not-so-kindly added Vladimir Putin over Trump's shoulder. \"There—I fixed it,\" he writes. (Trump also told 60 Minutes that he thinks the climate \"will change back again.\")\n#END SUMMARY"}

An appeals court has rejected the former Stanford University swimmer's bid for a new... (Associated Press) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An appeals court on Wednesday rejected a former Stanford University swimmer's bid for a new trial and upheld his sexual assault and attempted rape convictions. \n \n The three-judge panel of the 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose ruled Wednesday that there was \"substantial evidence\" that Brock Turner received a fair trial. \n \n In 2016, a jury convicted Turner of sexually assaulting an intoxicated and unconscious woman outside an on-campus fraternity party. \n \n The case got national attention after the victim's powerful statement, which she read in court before Turner was sentenced, was shared widely online. \n \n She recounted the assault, her treatment by investigators and the ordeal of facing questions about her sexual activity and drinking habits. It quickly went viral. \n \n \"Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney's questions that would be invasive, aggressive and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers,\" she wrote. \"This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth.\" \n \n The Associated Press doesn't generally identify sexual abuse victims. \n \n Judge Aaron Persky rejected a prosecutor's demand for a lengthy prison term and instead sentenced Turner to six months in jail. He was released from jail in September 2016 after serving three months. \n \n Persky's sentence sparked nationwide outrage by those who felt it too lenient. \n \n Voters recalled Persky in June. \n \n The sentence was not part of the appeal and the judges didn't address it. \n \n Turner filed an appeal in December seeking a new trial, arguing that the evidence presented at his trial didn't support his convictions. The jury convicted him of sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her. \n \n Judge Franklin Elia writing for the unanimous panel said there was \"substantial evidence\" to support conviction of all three charges. In particular, the judge pointed out that Turner tried to run from two graduate students who confronted him assaulting the then-22-year-old woman. The judge wrote that the victim was slurring her speech when she left a fraternity party with Turner and the graduate students testified the victim appeared unconscious when they showed up, chased Turner and held him down until police arrived. He denied running when questioned by police. \n \n \"He did not explain or defend himself to them,\" Elia wrote. \"And he lied to police about running.\" \n \n Turner could petition the California Supreme Court to consider his appeal. Turner's attorney Eric Multhaup didn't return a phone call Wednesday. \n \n Stanford law professor Michelle Dauber, who led the judge's recall campaign, called on Turner to drop any further appeals. \n \n \"The appellate court has now rejected that idea and I think everyone, including Brock Turner, would be better served by accepting the jury's verdict and moving on,\" she said. \n \n Turner lives outside Dayton, Ohio, with his parents. He is required to register as a sex offender for life. ||||| (CNN) A California appeals court rejected the appeal of Brock Turner, the former Stanford swimmer who sought to overturn his convictions stemming from a 2015 sexual assault of an unconscious woman. \n \n In 2016, Turner was convicted of assault with intent to rape, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person. As a result of the sentence, he must also register as a sex offender for life. \n \n In arguing for overturning the convictions, Multhaup took issue over when the victim, known as Emily Doe, became unconscious. The defense also contended that because Turner was \"fully clothed and engaged in forms of sexual conduct other than intercourse,\" it would \"negate an inference of intent to rape.\" \n \n \"We are not persuaded,\" the justices wrote in response to the attorney's arguments.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA California appeals court has ruled in the case of Brock Turner sooner than expected, upholding the former Stanford University swimmer's 2016 sexual assault and attempted rape convictions. Turner, who served three months of a six-month sentence, had been seeking a new trial in an effort to avoid registering as a sex offender for life. A three-judge panel on Wednesday unanimously rejected the request, arguing there was \"substantial evidence\" to convict, reports the AP. Lawyer Eric Multhaup previously said there was \"a lack of sufficient evidence\" to support the convictions of assault with intent to rape, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person, and sexual penetration of an unconscious person, per CNN. Multhaup specifically argued there was no intent to rape since Turner was fully clothed when he was found thrusting on a half-naked, unconscious woman outside of a 2015 campus party, saying Turner wasn't interested in intercourse but rather \"outercourse.\" The judges' reply: \"We are not persuaded.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

But county law enforcement says he went too far. \n \n James McDaniel says he did what any parent would do if an aggressive animal was attacking their child. He admits to hitting a Canada goose with a plastic Wiffle ball bat after he says the bird started chasing his 4-year-old son, Ethan. \n \n “A goose actually came from the other side of the field… and proceeded to go full wing span and chase after my son,” said McDaniel. \n \n He says he grabbed the only thing around: his son’s plastic bat. \n \n “So I swing one time, he [the goose] kind of topples over, I grab my son… and I ran across the street,” said McDaniel. \n \n And that swing, it seems, got feathers flying after a witness called police. \n \n “It was clearly attacking my son,” said McDaniel, “if anyone else had seen the whole incident, they would have known I was trying to protect my son.” \n \n Marion County Animal Services showed up and issued McDaniel a ticket for animal cruelty. The agency was unable to comment on the case because of pending litigation, but according to the incident report witnesses say they saw McDaniel hit the bird three times. The report also states the officer did take the goose to a local veterinarian. McDaniel maintains that he was only protecting his child. \n \n “FOX59 has shown before that these birds are becoming more and more aggressive,” said McDaniel, citing a report that aired on FOX59 in April regarding aggressive geese and the Department of Natural Resources response to them. \n \n “This is very frustrating because why should I not be allowed to protect my child against wildlife anywhere?” \n \n DNR officials said a person is allowed to protect themselves or others from wildlife, but can only use a reasonable amount of force based on the amount of harm a particular animal could inflict. McDaniel will go before a judge on Monday.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nAn Indianapolis man says he shouldn't have been ticketed for using a plastic bat to protect his 4-year-old son from an aggressive Canada goose, the AP reports.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nhypersensitivity to a mosquito bites ( hmb ) is a disorder characterized by intense skin reaction and various generalized symptoms subsequent to mosquito bites ( 1 ) . \n while this disorder is very rare, some cases of hmb mainly reported from east asia, primarily from japan ( 2 ) . \n however, recently a 7-yr -

(WLFI) — The search is still on for a missing Tippecanoe School Corporation teacher. \n \n Forty-two-year-old Krista Perdue was last seen late Sunday night by her husband at their home on Trackside Drive. \n \n Camon Milligan has lived next door to Perdue for seven years. She said they are close friends. \n \n In fact, the last time Milligan talked to Perdue was Saturday night when she says Perdue texted her saying she returned home from a nice vacation with her family. Milligan said the last thing Perdue said was “See you soon.” \n \n She says Perdue is married and has a 12-year-old daughter. \n \n Milligan says she can’t imagine Perdue leaving her family, especially her daughter. She said “leaving by choice would be completely out of character.” \n \n Milligan can’t understand why Perdue’s car, cellphone and purse are still at the house if she left. \n \n Perdue is a second grade teacher at TSC’s Woodland Elementary School. \n \n The school corporation released a statement: \n \n “Our school community is very concerned about Mrs. Perdue and is hoping for a safe return. The TSC is supporting police in the investigation.” \n \n The Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the disappearance. \n \n They don’t suspect foul play at this time, but said they aren’t ruling anything out. \n \n Deputy Chief Steve Hartman says they have issued subpoenas but wouldn’t specify what for. He did say they looked at Perdue’s cellphone and didn’t see that she called anyone for a ride or anything that would explain her disappearance. \n \n If you know anything about her whereabouts you are asked to call the sheriffs office immediately. \n \n Law enforcement is present at Perdue’s house Tuesday morning. Just before noon, officers went inside the home with Krista Perdue’s husband — Samuel Perdue. \n \n Samuel has not had a chance to speak with News 18 just yet, but we are hoping to get more from him coming up later on News 18 at Five and Six. \n \n Share this: Email \n \n Print \n \n Twitter \n \n Facebook \n \n Google \n \n More \n \n Pinterest \n \n Like this: Like Loading... ||||| × Tippecanoe County deputies searching for missing elementary school teacher \n \n UPDATE: Krista Perdue has been found alive in a wooded area near her home in Tippecanoe County. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n TIPPECANOE COUNTY, Ind. – The Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s Office is searching for a missing elementary school teacher. \n \n Krista Perdue, 42, was reported missing Monday morning, according to the Sheriff’s Office. \n \n Krista's husband told deputies she had been sick all day Sunday, so they slept in separate bedrooms Sunday night.

Samuel Perdue says his wife, 42-year-old Krista Perdue, got sick on Sunday so they slept in separate bedrooms. He says he went to check on her Monday morning after he \"kind of piddled around\" and discovered her missing. According to Fox 59, Samuel says he didn't hear Krista leave the house and has no idea where she would have gone. Her purse, driver's license, wallet, and car were still at their home. \"It's worrisome from the get-go under circumstances like that, where she has no means, no money, no phone,\" Tippecanoe County Chief Deputy Steve Hartman tells the Journal & Courier. \"So it's very concerning.\" Deputies don't suspect foul play at this point. Authorities looked at Krista's cellphone and didn't find evidence of her calling anyone for a ride or anything that would shed light on her whereabouts or reasons for leaving, WLFI reports. A neighbor says Krista texted her Saturday night that she had just gotten back from a family vacation. The neighbor says it \"would be completely out of character\" for Krista, who has a 12-year-old daughter, to leave her family.

(AP) — The last dry town in Connecticut is considering whether to give up on Prohibition. \n \n Bridgewater, an affluent bedroom community of 1,700 people tucked into the hills of western Connecticut, may have more at stake in a referendum than bragging rights: The town's average age has risen above 50 and the state is threatening to close the only school. \n \n First Selectman Curtis Read says restaurants that serve alcohol could provide a much-needed boost. \n \n \"It would tend to enliven the town,\" Read said. \n \n Repeal has become the hottest issue in Bridgewater, with dozens attending a November town meeting on the issue. Read said it was clear people were reluctant to \"show their cards\" and a referendum was chosen in part for privacy, so that voters do not have to reveal opinions to neighbors. The timing of the vote, originally scheduled for Tuesday, now remains to be determined after it was postponed to make sure it complies with decades-old blue laws. \n \n Cynthia Bennett, whose grandmother led an effort to keep Bridgewater dry after Prohibition ended in 1933, said she believes many fellow longtime residents will join her in voting against alcohol sales. \n \n \"I feel people moved here because Bridgewater is the way it is and I'd like to keep it that way,\" said Bennett, 55. \"I'm not saying you don't, say, have a game of horseshoes and have a beer. There's plenty of it in Bridgewater.\" \n \n Bridgewater has taken up the issue for the first time since 1930s because two developers proposed opening restaurants, as long as they could serve alcohol. Some residents have bars in their garages but the town, which is home to actress Mia Farrow and a large weekend population of people from New York City, currently does not have a restaurant aside from a village store with a delicatessen. \n \n Read won the top job in November after his predecessor, William Stuart, declined to run for re-election to a position he held for 30 years. A leader of a local fox-hunting club, Stuart championed land preservation and kept development at bay. The FBI raided the town hall in 2012, and Stuart said he assumed was the target, but the FBI has since declined to comment on the status of any investigation. \n \n Today, the town 60 miles north of New York has a median household income of about $100,000, but it has a glut of homes on the market and the last census showed the median age is 51. Farms dot the town that is full of picturesque, winding rural roads but has little downtown beyond the town hall and a post office. \n \n A plan for a consolidated regional elementary school, subject to a vote in April, could lead to the closing of the town's only grade school. \n \n \"The town definitely needs a boost,\" said Read, who said the restaurants could provide a bit of local employment and a place to socialize. \n \n One of the restaurant proposals came from Peter and Leni May, part-time residents from New York City who own the century-old building in downtown Bridgewater that hosts the village store. They suggested opening a pub-style restaurant in an adjacent space left vacant by the closing of a bank last June. Their local agent, Greg Bollard, said he was disappointed by the referendum's postponement, and it could even take the restaurant proposal off the table, but the family is committed to finding a business that will benefit the town center. \n \n \"We all want see to some positive growth for the town,\" Bollard said.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nConnecticut's last dry town is on the verge of a historic decision: whether to allow two local developers to open restaurants that serve alcohol, the AP reports. As it stands, the upscale bedroom community of Bridgewater is on the sleepy side, with 1,700 people, an average age above 50, and only a single school (which the state is threatening to shut down). So alcohol in restaurants \"would tend to enliven the town,\" said First Selectman Curtis Read—as would the restaurants themselves, since Bridgewater doesn't currently have any, the Litchfield County Times reports. (It does have bars run by residents in their garages, but that's another story.) For the repeal of Prohibition to pass—81 years after the 18th Amendment was cast aside—the developers need a simple majority in a vote on Tuesday. And they're saying a \"no\" vote would be a dealbreaker, because restaurants just can't survive without serving drinks: \"Both restaurants are dependent upon being able to serve alcohol,\" said a developer's rep. \"It’s not only on an economic level, but it’s about being competitive and creating an ambiance of what people expect to have in their dining experience.\" Two neat factoids: The vote would only be a \"partial\" repeal (for alcohol served in restaurants), and local resident Mia Farrow may be among the voters.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it.

Mr. Cook’s pay increase was driven by his cash bonus, which was hinged on exceeding... ||||| Tim Cook, one of the world’s most prominent technology executives and an outspoken advocate for human rights, takes a private jet for personal and business travel to ensure his safety. \n \n Apple disclosed it spent $224,216 on security services this year to protect its CEO, and footed the bill for $93,109 in air travel expenses for his personal use of private aircraft. \n \n “For security reasons, the board requires that Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel,” Apple reported in a filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n \n Cook earned roughly $12.8 million in total compensation in 2017, the filing noted, an amount that includes his $3 million annual salary, bonuses of $9.3 million and other forms of compensation — including contributions to his retirement savings plan, his life insurance premiums and security expenses. \n \n Other Apple executives brought in bigger packages, with retail chief Angela Ahrendts, hardware head Johny Srouji and chief financial officer Luca Maestri all receiving total compensation exceeding $24 million this year. \n \n Cook’s payday as head of the world’s largest corporation (by market cap) looks modest when compared with some of his counterparts in the media world, like Disney CEO Bob Iger, whose package totaled $43.9 million in 2016, or CBS’ Leslie Moonves, whose $68.6 million package made him one of the highest-paid CEOs in American business.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe pay cut that CEO Tim Cook and other Apple execs received after a rare slump in sales last year has been reversed—and then some. According to a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a cash bonus for exceeding the board's sales and profit targets boosted Cook's total compensation for 2017 to $12.8 million, marking a 47% year-on-year rise, the Wall Street Journal reports. That includes his salary of $3 million, bonuses of around $9.3 million, and other forms of compensation. A previously disclosed equity award of $89.2 million makes Cook's total for the year more than $100 million. The securities filing also disclosed that the board \"requires that Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel\" for security reasons, Deadline reports. The filing listed around $93,000 in private aircraft expenses for Cook, as well as $224,000 for security services to protect him. Five other top Apple execs received bonuses of more than $3 million, according to the filing, though it does not disclose what the company paid Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, who is \"considered by some to be its most important employee,\" Bloomberg notes.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nBERLIN (AP) — German police on Thursday raided the homes of nine elderly men suspected of serving as SS guards at the Auschwitz death camp and arrested three of them on allegations of accessory to murder. \n \n Undated file photo shows the main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, in Poland, which was liberated by the Russians, in January 1945. Writing over the gate reads: \"Arbeit macht frei\" (Work... (Associated Press) \n \n The arrests came five months after federal authorities announced they would investigate former guards at Auschwitz and other Nazi-era death camps. Their effort was inspired by the precedent-setting trial of former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died in 2012 in a Bavarian nursing home while appealing his conviction on charges he served at the Sobibor camp. \n \n \"This is a major step,\" said Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, when told of the arrests. \"Given the advanced age of the defendants, every effort should be made to expedite their prosecution.\" \n \n Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was the first person convicted in Germany solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in any specific killing. \n \n Munich prosecutors successfully argued that anyone who was involved in operating a death camp was an accessory to murder. Demjanjuk maintained he had been mistaken for someone else and never served as a guard. \n \n Following the Munich precedent, Germany's special federal prosecutors' office responsible for investigating Nazi war crimes announced in September it was recommending charges against about 30 suspected former Auschwitz guards. State prosecutors since have worked to build cases. \n \n The three men arrested, aged 88, 92 and 94, all live in state of Baden Wuerttemberg in southwest Germany. They were taken to a prison hospital, Stuttgart prosecutors' spokeswoman Claudia Krauth said. \n \n Krauth said officials had yet to uncover enough evidence to merit the arrests of three other suspects aged 94, 91 and 90. \n \n She said authorities seized \"diverse papers and documents from the Nazi era\" from the suspects' homes. She declined to provide details. \n \n Five men made no statements, while the 88-year-old admitted being a guard at Auschwitz but denied committing any crimes, Krauth said. \n \n Prosecutors in Frankfurt said more documents and photographs were seized during raids on the homes of two men aged 89 and 92 in the neighboring state of Hesse. A spokeswoman, Doris Mueller-Scheu, said neither suspect was arrested nor made statements. \n \n In North Rhine-Westphalia, state police said they raided the apartment of a 92-year-old man who admitted being an Auschwitz guard but denied participating in any crimes. They found no incriminating material during the search. \n \n The Nazis built six main death camps, all in occupied Poland: Auschwitz, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka. \n \n About 1.5 million people, primarily Jews, were killed at Auschwitz from 1940 to 1945. Overall, about 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust. \n \n Since handing off the Auschwitz cases to state prosecutors, federal authorities say they are focusing on identifying guards from other camps, starting with Majdanek. Results of that investigation are expected in a few months. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Auschwitz-Birkenau was the largest death camp in World War Two Nazi-occupied Poland \n \n Three men aged 88, 92 and 94 have been detained by German authorities on suspicion of being guards at the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. \n \n The homes of a number of men were raided in three German states, months after prosecutors investigating Nazi-era war crimes announced they were recommending charges against 30 people. \n \n The three men taken into custody have been sent to a prison hospital. \n \n More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz. \n \n The three men detained all live in the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and are suspected of involvement in murders that took place between 1942-45. They were taken to Hohenasperg prison hospital in Ludwigsburg, reports say. \n \n Raids also took place in the states of Hessen and North Rhine-Westphalia, although none of the suspects was arrested. \n \n The decision to take action against alleged Nazi guards followed the conviction in May 2011 of John Demjanjuk. \n \n A court decided that by being a worker at a concentration camp he was guilty of being an accessory to murder. This meant that courts did not have to prove active participation in killing to find a suspect guilty of murder, BBC Berlin correspondent Stephen Evans reports. \n \n Demjanjuk, who died in 2012 aged 91, had denied being a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. \n \n He had been sentenced to five years in jail for being an accessory to the murder of 28,060 people but died in a home for the elderly while the case was pending appeal.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIn a last push to punish Nazi atrocities, German authorities have swooped in on the homes of nine suspected former guards at the Auschwitz death camp. Three men aged 88, 92, and 94 were arrested yesterday in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and are now in a prison hospital, reports the AP. Officials say \"diverse papers and documents from the Nazi era\" were seized from the men's homes, but not enough evidence was uncovered for the other six men to be arrested. The only suspect to make a statement was the 88-year-old, who admitted being a guard at the camp where an estimated 1.1 million people were murdered but denied committing any crimes. The effort to track down former Auschwitz guards was launched after the conviction of John Demjanjuk, in which a court decided that being a guard at a death camp was enough to warrant conviction for being an accessory to murder, the BBC reports. \"This is a major step,\" says the chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem. \"Given the advanced age of the defendants, every effort should be made to expedite their prosecution.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

We want to be helpful,\" he said. \n \n Tillerson on Paris Accord and North Korea \n \n His comments came after the White House denied any change to the Trump administration's position on the Paris climate agreement, after The Wall Street Journal, citing a European Union official, reported the U.S. will not back out of the deal. \n \n \"There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement,\" White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement on Saturday. \"As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.\" ||||| Nicaragua will reportedly join the Paris climate accord, leaving the U.S. and Syria as the only two nations left refusing to support the landmark deal to fight global warming. \n \n Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega told state media that his government planned to sign the agreement “soon,” according to a report from the Managua-based television station 100% Noticias. A call seeking comment to the Nicaraguan embassy in Washington wasn’t immediately returned Wednesday. \n \n Ortega had initially refused to join the 2015 accord brokered in the French capital, saying the deal didn’t require enough sacrifice from wealthy nations. President Donald Trump said in June that he would pull the U.S. from the accord because it imposed too many restrictions on U.S. companies. \n \n — With assistance by Eric Roston ||||| Nicaragua was one of the final holdouts on signing the Paris Agreement on climate change, but after seeing other countries deal with devastating natural disasters, the country is joining the deal. \n \n That leaves the United States and Syria as the only countries not participating. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. vowed to pull out earlier this year after Obama signed the climate agreement in 2015. Syria rejected it outright. \n \n Nicaragua hadn't signed before because its leaders thought the deal didn't go far enough to fight climate change. On Monday, the Latin American country announced it was signing to support other nations vulnerable to the effects of climate change, like sea level rise and coastal flooding. \n \n Nicaragua confirms intent to join the #ParisAgreement on climate change: https://t.co/3tgzsRnvGk via @elnuevodiario — WRI Climate (@WRIClimate) September 20, 2017 \n \n Many noticed that Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega said in an announcement that his country was joining in solidarity with countries reeling from the destruction of natural disasters. \n \n \"The main reason\" Nicaragua is joining: \"Solidarity with the countries most vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters.\" \n \n \n \n Imagine that. — Emily Atkin (@emorwee) September 20, 2017 \n \n Recent hurricanes battering the Caribbean and U.S. come to mind. Climate studies indicate that hurricane impacts, including storm surge flooding and heavy rainfall, are already worsening due to human-caused global warming. \n \n As the world continues to warm, hurricanes are expected to contain stronger winds as well, and may be more prone to periods of rapid intensification. So far this season, the U.S. has been hit by three Category 4 hurricanes, which is unprecedented since reliable records began in the late 19th century. \n \n The World Resource Institute's climate program global director Paula Caballero said we should be celebrating that Nicaragua is on board. In a phone call she said it sends a \"powerful message for the two countries\" refusing to get involved. Though Syria is dealing with a long, devastating military conflict, so climate treaties aren't a top priority right now. \n \n She acknowledged Nicaragua has been \"committed to tackling climate change\" and already working on lowering its dependence on carbon. By signing the agreement, she said the country can only improve its climate impact and economy. \n \n Now let's see if Donald Trump notices that the only other country not part of the deal is in the middle of a civil war. \n \n Andrew Freedman contributed reporting.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWhen President Trump announced earlier this year that the US would pull out of the Paris climate accord, much of the coverage pointed out that only Nicaragua and Syria were also in the \"no\" camp. That group just got a little smaller: Nicaragua plans to sign the accord, leaving the US and Syria as the only holdouts, reports Mashable. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega told state media Wednesday that he would sign the pact soon, per Bloomberg. Nicaragua initially opposed the agreement because it said it wasn't strong enough, particularly in what it asked of wealthy nations. Trump opposes the deal because he says it would impose too many restrictions on American companies. However, reports have surfaced of late that the US may be softening its position and will strike some kind of compromise in order to sign the deal. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to confirm the possibility over the weekend, reports CBS News.\n#END SUMMARY"}

In recent weeks, talks have centered around the specific roles of Ms. Brown, new Newsweek owner Sidney Harman and Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of Daily Beast owner IAC/InterActive Corp. \n \n Talks were hung up on the issue of how control would be divided among the three people, all of whom are heavily invested financially and emotionally in their respective news operations and not inclined to cede control, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Harman, a stereo-equipment magnate, recently acquired Newsweek from Washington Post Co. \n \n \"The engagement was fun but the pre-nup got too complex,\" Ms. Brown said in a memo to her staff. \"We wish Newsweek all the best.\" \n \n The people familiar with the matter said talks broke down over the weekend because the two parties couldn't come to an agreement on governance and editorial control. In a joint statement, Messrs. Harman and Diller said they \"mutually decided not to pursue\" the talks. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Daily Beast co-founder and co-owner Tina Brown, seen last year in New York. \n \n \"Sidney Harman presented us with an interesting possibility, but we would only consider a partnership on terms that made sense for the thriving Daily Beast,\" Ms. Brown said in an email. \"We weren't able to come to terms, but I wish him the best of luck.\" \n \n Mr. Harman, who acquired Newsweek this summer for $1 plus liabilities, has said he bought the unprofitable magazine because he was excited about the challenge of reviving it and has strong convictions about how to carry that out. Even as talks about a merger advanced, Mr. Harman had reservations about handing over the reins of his new property to a strong-willed editor who reported to another boss in Mr. Diller, said people familiar with his thinking. \n \n A merger with the Daily Beast was attractive to Newsweek because it offered an immediate injection of editorial talent to Newsweek's depleted ranks and the potential to pare expenses at a publication on track to lose at least $20 million this year. \n \n The top editorial spot at Newsweek has been vacant since longtime editor Jon Meacham stepped down over the summer. Mr. Harman has interviewed a number of candidates including former New York Observer editor Peter Kaplan, people familiar with the situation said. Mr. Kaplan already indicated to Mr. Harman he is committed to his current post as editorial director of the Fairchild Fashion Group, a person familiar with the matter said. A person familiar with Mr. Harman's thinking said he is talking to several \"excellent candidates.\" \n \n For its part, the Daily Beast stood to gain from a global print platform on top of cost-saving opportunities. The two-year-old site is on pace to lose about $10 million this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, Daily Beast executives said the site is on track to be profitable within the next two years. \n \n The Daily Beast publishes a mix of news and commentary from its own staff and outside sources.

There had been much buzz in recent weeks about a potential merger between the growing site and the struggling magazine, which was recently unloaded by the Washington Post Company. The potential deal would have seen Brown assume editorial control of the magazine, but an agreement couldn't be reached on how Brown, new Newsweek owner Sidney Harman, and Beast backer Barry Diller would share control. \"The engagement was fun but the pre-nup got too complex,\" wrote Brown in a memo to her staff today, obtained by Intel. \"We wish Newsweek all the best.\" \n \n Daily Beast Drops Out of Talks With Newsweek [WSJ]\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe Daily Beast and Newsweek have pulled off a pre-marital divorce, reports the Wall Street Journal, with merger talks breaking down over the weekend over the finer points of editorial control. Though both parties stood to save costs by consolidating the editorial staff, the Journal notes that Beast co-owners Tina Brown and Barry Diller, and new Newsweek owner Stephen Harman are all heavily invested both financially and emotionally in their properties. For her part, Brown wrote in a memo about the proposed merger that: \"The engagement was fun but the pre-nup got too complex. We wish Newsweek all the best.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Because I haven’t heard it. I mean, I just … I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It’s what you have to do,” Trump said during an interview with editors for The Economist. \n \n The president also cited the phrase “priming the pump” when answering a question about his tax plan increasing the deficit. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “Well, it actually did,” Trump answered, disagreeing with the editors, who said the Reagan tax plan did not increase the deficit. \n \n “But, but it’s called priming the pump. You know, if you don’t do that, you’re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the healthcare [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, ‘Why isn’t he going with taxes first, that’s his wheelhouse?'\" Trump said. \n \n “Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many congressmen, to go with it. And they’re great people, but one of the great things about getting healthcare is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400 [billion] to $900 [billion],” the president said. \n \n Merriam-Webster later noted that the phrase has been used to refer to government investment expenditures since the early 1930s. \n \n The phrase 'priming the pump' dates to the early 19th century. — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) May 11, 2017 \n \n In the interview with The Economist, Trump also described his approach as “Trumponomics.” \n \n “Well it’s an interesting question,” Trump said when asked how \"Trumponomics\" is different from historic Republican economics. \n \n “I don’t think it’s ever been asked quite that way.

That's a very interesting question … at some point I'll release them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\" \n \n The U.S. president clarified later in the Economist interview and reversed himself, saying that he would, in fact, never release his tax returns as part of a potential agreement with Democrats as it would be \"unfair\" and \"disrespectful\" to agree to such a deal. \n \n Trump also said the U.S. would make \"tremendous savings\" in tax reductions should Congress approve one of his top campaign pledges, and a multi-year Republican pursuit, to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature health-care law. \n \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sat alongside Trump in the White House interview and confirmed the president's claim that the U.S. would stand to benefit between \"$400 billion to $900 billion\" with the proposed health-care plan. \n \n Read The Economist's full transcript here.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nPresident Trump is making headlines because of an interview with the Economist, though probably not the ones he expected. One theme is on an odd claim he made about inventing the long-used phrase \"priming the pump,\" and another on the possibility of his releasing his tax returns—when he's out of the White House. The details: At one point, Trump asks the interviewer if he's ever heard of the phrase \"priming the pump,\" which has been widely used in economic circles for at least the better part of a century. \"Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven’t heard it. I mean, I just … I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It’s what you have to do.\" As the Hill reports, Merriam-Webster quickly pounced. \"'Pump priming' has been used to refer to government investment expenditures since at least 1933,\" it tweeted. Another said: \"The phrase 'priming the pump' dates to the early 19th century.\" At the Washington Post, Philip Bump is baffled. He cites multiple examples of Trump himself using the phrase previously and thus floats the possibility that Trump was joking. Or maybe he just \"slipped into his long-standing pattern of taking credit where it wasn’t due.\" On the tax returns, Trump was asked if he'd be willing to release them in order to get Democratic support for his tax plan, notes CNBC. \"That's a very interesting question,\" he said. \"I doubt it.\" He added that \"at some point I'll release them\" because \"I'm very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\" And later: \"I might release them after I'm out of office.\" Click for the full transcript, which includes the president's thoughts on \"Trumponomics\" as referring to \"self-respect as a nation\" and \"trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal.\"\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images \n \n A video apparently released by the Islamic State group shows 25 men being shot dead in the ancient city of Palmyra, in Syria. \n \n IS said the men were soldiers captured in the city of Homs. They were shot dead inside Palmyra's amphitheatre. \n \n Stills from the video showed the killers to be young males, possibly even as young as 13 or 14. \n \n IS captured Palmyra and the neighbouring modern city, locally known as Tadmur, in late May. \n \n The video was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. It is not clear when it was filmed. \n \n The killings took place on a stage in the amphitheatre in front of a large black IS flag. \n \n Several hundred men in civilian clothes are filmed sitting on steps watching the shootings. Among them was a young boy. \n \n In close-up shots of the men waiting to be killed, they appear to have been beaten on the face. \n \n Days after IS claimed Palmyra, it executed 20 men in the same amphitheatre. \n \n The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says shootings took place in the amphitheatre on 27 May, but it is not clear if those killings are the ones in the video. \n \n The video goes on to show the destruction of Tadmur prison, which occurred in late May. \n \n In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria's head of antiquities, said: \"Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.\" \n \n Mr Abdulkarim said most of the museum's antiquities had been transferred to Damascus before IS approached the city. \n \n Since then, there have been reports that mines have been planted among some of Palmyra's ruins, and there were claims this week that militants destroyed an ancient sculpture outside Palmyra's museum. \n \n Since capturing the city, IS has also taken control of a military airbase and a notorious prison nearby. \n \n The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. \n \n Fighters with IS started claiming vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, aided in part by the insecurity generated by Syria's civil war. \n \n More than 230,000 Syrians have died in the war, which began after President Bashar al-Assad's forces tried to put down anti-government protests in March 2011. ||||| The Islamic State militant group released a video on Saturday claiming to show the mass execution of Syrian government soldiers in the historic amphitheater of Syria's Palmyra. \n \n The video shows 25 men lined up on the stage of the ancient theater in front of the extremist group's flag. They are then shot dead by boys, who appear to be in their teens, before an audience gathered at the heritage site. The 10-minute video was released by the group's local branch in the Syrian province of Homs, according to the SITE intelligence group. \n \n Screenshot of the militant video. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights first reported that the Islamic State group had publicly executed a group of men in Palmyra's amphitheater in late May, shortly after the militants captured the area from government forces. The monitoring group said the men were accused of fighting for the Syrian government, and that local residents were forced to come and watch the mass execution. \n \n Islamic State supporters also celebrated the killings on Twitter at the time, Reuters reported. \n \n Screenshot of the militant video \n \n Islamic State militants seized control of historic city, known in Arabic as Tadmur, in May. It was the first time the extremist group had directly captured territory from regime forces rather than a Syrian rebel group. Syrian activists said several hundred civilians were killed by the extremists after they captured the city, according to the Observatory. \n \n The video released Saturday also purports to show militants blowing up a notoriously hellish prison compound in the city. The Observatory first reported in late May that the group had blown up the prison as part of its propaganda campaign. \n \n The group has also used its control over ancient treasures in Syria and Iraq to push its propaganda messages to an international audience. On Thursday, the group boasted in a statement that it had destroyed six archaeological artifacts in the city, which is over 2,000 years old and a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nEarlier this week, Islamic State militants publicly destroyed more priceless relics in the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria, reports the Washington Post. Today, the group released a video showing it making use of the city in an even more heinous way—to stage a mass execution of Syrian soldiers, reports the BBC. The video shows about 25 men being shot to death in the Palmyra amphitheater—by gunmen who appear to be about 13 or 14 years old. Militants reportedly forced hundreds of local residents to witness the killings. As the Huffington Post notes, a group of Syrian soldiers were reportedly executed at the site in late May, and this may be the video of that slaughter.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe saying goes, \"Don't mess with Texas,\" and that seems to hold true for a San Antonio homeowner. \n \n Ken Lamkin is getting back at the Grinch who stole his Christmas decor from his lawn southwest of the city. \n \n \"He was so slow and methodical, that's what reminded us of the story of the Grinch,\" he said. \n \n Lamkin is shaming the guy who stole his fog machine and inflatable. \n \n \"It was 16 feet long and it's eight reindeer that were animated,\" he said. \n \n The theft was caught on camera. It happened around 3 a.m. on Christmas Eve, and took about five minutes. It was later that day that Lamkin got an idea. \n \n \"And we ran over and made some black and white pictures and mounted them on some cardboard, and this is what you have: our new Grinch-themed Christmas,\" he said. \n \n But he didn't stop there. He has a projector that is playing the theft in his front yard. \n \n \"It doesn't only show that we know who you are, but it is also to show that you can't take our Christmas,\" Lamkin said. \"We are going to sit down here and hold hands, and we are going to sing and enjoy Christmas.\" \n \n Lamkin said that he hopes the thief realizes that everyone still loves Christmas: \n \n \"Maybe your heart can grow 10 sizes today-and you can go around and return the stuff you took.” \n \n © 2018 KENS-TV ||||| SAN ANTONIO (WOAI) - A homeowner along Luckey River on San Antonio’s southwest side is comparing what happened outside his home to something from “The Grinch.” \n \n “Just like in the story 'The Grinch,' if his heart could grow 10 sizes, maybe he would not just bring our stuff back, maybe he'd bring everybody's stuff back,” said Ken Lamkin, the impacted homeowner. \n \n Early on Christmas Eve, surveillance video captured someone stealing Christmas decorations outside Lamkin’s home. According to Lamkin, the thief stole about $400 worth of decorations. \n \n \"It reminded me of the movie 'The Grinch,' when the Grinch was going through town taking everybody's presents and decorations,” said Lamkin. \"We're not going to let some Grinch steal our Christmas from us.\" \n \n WOAI had to blur the crook’s face because of the ongoing investigation but Lamkin used it as inspiration. \n \n \"We printed up some posters, put them up on some poster board,” said Lamkin. “We wanted to keep it in the spirit of things, so we made it like a Christmas decoration.” \n \n His home’s yard is now filled with six screenshot photos of the alleged suspect captured from a surveillance video. “The Grinch” song is also being played on repeat outside, while a projector screen shows the surveillance tape. \n \n “We're going to watch this Grinch and just sit around and enjoy the night,” said Lamkin. \n \n Whoever is responsible managed to get away, but Lamkin remains optimistic for his own storybook ending. \n \n “Hopefully something will happen, and it will touch his heart, and he will change,” said Lamkin. “Maybe he'll return all of the things he has stolen, just like the Grinch did.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThere's catching a thief on surveillance camera, and then there's this bizarre incident out of San Antonio, Texas. Homeowner Kan Lamkin woke on Christmas morning to discover that somebody had stolen his 16-foot inflatable reindeer-themed decoration, reports WFAA. The problem for the still-unidentified thief is that the whole 5-minute caper was caught on video. First, Lamkin made large black-and-white photos of the thief and mounted them on cardboard on his front lawn. Then he set up a projector and began replaying the theft over and over, set to a familiar holiday tune. \"It reminded me of the movie the Grinch,' when the Grinch was going through town taking everybody's presents and decorations,” Lamkin tells News 4 San Antonio of that musical choice. \"We're not going to let some Grinch steal our Christmas from us.\" So far, no arrests have been made, but Lamkin is holding out hope that the real-life Grinch will mimic his fictional counterpart and return everything he stole.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Col. Imron Yunus said. \n \n The landslide occurred at a tea plantation near the mountainous village of Tenjoljaya in the Ciwidey district after days of heavy rain, he said. \n \n Yunus said more than 60 people remained under the mud and debris, which covered at least 50 houses near the Perkebunan Teh Dewata tea plantation. \n \n Yunus said five bodies had been pulled from the mud. \n \n (This version CORRECTS village name to Tenjoljaya in graf 3) ||||| Heavy rain triggered floods in the area last week At least five people have been killed and dozens are missing after a huge landslide buried a village in West Java, Indonesia, officials say. Rescue teams have been sent to look for survivors at a tea plantation near Bandung, south of the capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the landslide, which is reported to have hit a workers' housing area in the morning. Landslides triggered by monsoon rain or floods are common in Indonesia. Bandung has had particularly heavy rains and floods, with scores of people fleeing from their homes to safety during the past two weeks. Communication problems More than 300 search and rescue personnel with heavy equipment are heading to the area, near Ciwidey village, about 35km (22 miles) south-west of Bandung city, officials say. \"It had been raining very heavily since yesterday [Monday] and that probably caused the landslide,\" Disaster Management Agency spokesman Priyadi Kardono told the AFP news agency. \"We believe the landslide area could be the size of two football fields. The tea-processing plant and 50 houses were also buried.\" Another official said some houses were buried so deep that even the rooftops were invisible. The plantation owns barracks to provide housing for its hundreds of workers. Mr Kardono said roads to the area had been blocked: \"We're facing problems trying to reach them.\" Rescue efforts are also being hampered by poor communication due to the collapse of a mobile phone tower which was brought down by the landslide. As no heavy earth-moving equipment was available in the area, villagers were digging through tonnes of mud with farm tools and their bare hands to search for survivors, police Chief Lt Col Imron Yunus told the Associated Press news agency. The Indonesian Red Cross said about 500 villagers who lost their homes had been moved to temporary shelters in neighbouring villages. Landslides - especially during the rainy season - are frequent in Indonesia, where years of deforestation can often leave hillsides vulnerable to collapse, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta. According to environmentalists, tropical downpours can quickly soak hills stripped of vegetation which had held the soil in place. \n \n \n \n Bookmark with: Delicious \n \n Digg \n \n reddit \n \n Facebook \n \n StumbleUpon What are these?

Villagers are digging through tons of mud with farm tools and their bare hands searching for survivors, the AP reports. Days of heavy rain have soaked the area south of Jakarta, leaving roads impassable. A cell phone tower was brought down in the landslide, further hampering the rescue effort. The region has been experiencing heavier rains than usual this year, causing floods that have forced hundreds from their homes. Deforestation in the area has stripped hillsides of their cover, increasing the risk and severity of landslides, the BBC notes.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nShe is also grateful for the community support they received in Hamilton and specifically the Mount Hope area. \n \n \"It was crazy, like, hundreds of people were calling and texting me to see if they could help.

He was cold and scared, but otherwise in good condition. \n \n Pittman, a Halifax resident who took a flight to Hamilton on Thursday after learning her dog was missing, said she was grateful for Hamilton residents' help and enthusiasm in finding her pet. \n \n \"Knowing that people were spotting him running in the same area gave me more hope,\" said Pittman, holding Cooper and surrounded by the people who helped track him down. \n \n I was coming out of Timmies, and I saw it run across the parking lot, so I chased it down to where it ran down this road. - Louis Atkinson \n \n \"Thousands of people helped me. With all the [social media] shares, and people searching and calling. Random people messaged me asking how they can help, and they're out around at three, four in the morning, looking around.\" \n \n Pittman started getting calls about her dog around 7:30 a.m., from neighbours near the airport who had spotted him running through their backyards. They tried to approach him, but he ran off, scared. \n \n Louis Atkinson, who lives in the area, first spotted Cooper running across a parking lot near a Tim Hortons. \n \n \"He was running, looked scared,\" said Atkinson. \n \n \"I was coming out of Timmies, and I saw it run across the parking lot, so I chased it down to where it ran down this road.\" \n \n Put on wrong flight \n \n Cooper's adventure began Wednesday. \n \n Pittman's pet was supposed to travel from Halifax to Deer Lake, N.L., to be with her family while she and her roommate headed to Jamaica for a wedding. \n \n Instead, WestJet put Cooper on a flight bound for Hamilton. \n \n After a night out in torrential rains, Cooper the dog has been reunited with his family. 0:42 \n \n WestJet told Pittman that Cooper arrived in Hamilton about midnight on Wednesday. Some time after, airline workers lost Cooper. \n \n \"I got a call saying they'd put my dog on the wrong flight to a totally different province,\" she said. The airline told her Cooper escaped from his collar when airline staff let the dog out for a potty break. \n \n Westjet says it has offered to pay for Cooper's vet bill, and will work on getting everyone back home as soon as they are rested. \n \n \"Our primary focus was reuniting Cooper and his owner, and we are in touch with Terri to make sure he is okay,\" said spokesperson Lauren Stewart in an email. \n \n Helping hands \n \n At one point Thursday, Pittman asked WestJet over the phone to put Cooper's crate, left open and with familiar-smelling things inside, by the road so that he might return to it. The crate was there for several hours, \"but someone stole it a few hours ago,\" she told CBC Hamilton on Thursday evening. \n \n Pittman took a flight to Hamilton in the middle of a massive rain and thunderstorm to look for her dog, calling Thursday \"one of the worst days of my life.\" \n \n But soon, people in Hamilton came to help. \n \n \"The community of Mount Hope and Hamilton have been amazing,\" Pittman said. \"Random people have messaged me saying they want to help.\"\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nRelieved dog owner Terri Pittman has been reunited with her labradoodle after what was supposed to be a short flight turned into a nightmare that lasted days. On Wednesday, she sent Cooper to stay with relatives while she went to a wedding in Jamaica—but instead of putting the dog on its flight from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Deer Lake, Newfoundland, WestJet put the dog on the wrong flight and it ended up in Hamilton, Ontario, more than 1,000 miles away in the wrong direction, the CBC reports. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Cooper slipped his leash and ran away after airport workers in Hamilton took him outside to pee. Pittman flew to Hamilton when she found out about the mix-up and searched the fields around the airport for Cooper, joined by many local volunteers who had heard about the search on social media. After a night of torrential rains, residents spotted Cooper around a mile away from the airport, Friday morning, the Hamilton Spectator reports. In a Facebook post, Pittman says it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to be reunited with Cooper after two terrible days. She says she was overwhelmed by the response. \"The fact that strangers I did not know or had even met ... were out looking for him at night through morning, or messaging me to see how they could help is simply amazing,\" she says.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nDuring live coverage of the Republican National Convention here in Tampa, Yahoo News Washington bureau chief David Chalian provided the perfect example of the pervasive anti-Republican bias Mitt Romney faces in his bid to unseat President Barack Obama. \n \n In video broadcast Monday night by ABC and Yahoo over the Internet, Chalian can be heard claiming that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann are unconcerned about the fate of residents of the New Orleans area who are currently being hit by Hurricane Isaac. \n \n “They aren’t concerned at all,” Chalian can be heard on the live broadcast. “They are happy to have a party with black people drowning.” \n \n That line elicits laughter from several employees listening in on the joke. \n \n From the audio, it appears Chalian was talking to an unknown individual named “John” who appears to have made some sort of quip which cannot be heard on the video. \n \n The anti-Romney joke was made while Chalian was on an active microphone, apparently unaware that his quips against the former Massachusetts governor were being recorded and broadcast live. \n \n Unmentioned by Chalian was the fact that the Republican National Committee canceled the entirety of Monday's program or that President Obama did not cancel any of his regularly scheduled campaign fund-raising parties that night. \n \n Update 12:13. This item has been updated and corrected. It originally stated that the person on the audio was likely an ABC News employee. That is incorrect. \n \n It was originally streamed by ABC and Yahoo and no correction or retraction was made during the broadcast as far as we are aware. \n \n Update 1:48. Yahoo! fires Chalian. \n \n (HT NB reader Northstar) ||||| TAMPA, Fla. -- Yahoo News has fired Washington bureau chief David Chalian after he was caught on a hot-mic during an online video broadcast saying that Republican convention officials had no problem with African Americans suffering as a result of Hurricane Isaac, a source familiar with the situation tells POLITICO. (Now confirmed: see below) \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Update: Isaac pounds NOLA) \n \n \"They're not concerned at all. They're happy to have a party with black people drowning,\" Chalian said over a break during the ABC News/Yahoo News webcast, in reference to the fact that the GOP convention in Tampa is taking place as Hurricane Isaac makes landfall on the north Gulf coast. \n \n (PHOTOS: 5 crazy convention moments) \n \n The conservative media watchdog organization NewsBusters first posted audio of Chalian's remarks, but referred to him as an ABC News employee (and offered slightly inaccurate transcription). ABC News spokesperson Julie Townsend informed the organization that Chalian was with Yahoo. \n \n Chalian and Yahoo News spokesperson Kristen Morquecho did not respond to requests for comment; Townsend also did not respond to a request for comment. (ABC News, where Chalian was political director until 2010, has partnered with Yahoo News for 2012 political coverage). \n \n UPDATE (1:30 p.m.): Yahoo News confirms: \n \n \"David Chalian's statement was inappropriate and does not represent the views of Yahoo!. He has been terminated effective immediately. We have already reached out to the Romney campaign, and we apologize to Mitt Romney, his staff, their supporters and anyone who was offended.\" \n \n UPDATE (5:11 p.m.): David Chalian apologizes, on Facebook: \n \n I am profoundly sorry for making an inappropriate and thoughtless joke. I was commenting on the challenge of staging a convention during a hurricane and about campaign optics. I have apologized to the Romney campaign, and I want to take this opportunity to publicly apologize to Gov. and Mrs. Romney. I also regret causing any distraction from the exceptional coverage of the Republican convention by Yahoo News and ABC News. \n \n This post has been updated to better reflect Chalian's remarks.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nRemember when Hurricane Katrina spurred Kanye West to say that George W. Bush didn't care about black people? Well, this is kinda like that—except it involves a reporter, not a celebrity. Seems a hot mic caught Yahoo News Washington bureau chief David Chalian saying today, during a webcast, that Mitt and Ann Romney are \"not concerned at all\" about the effects of Hurricane Isaac on African Americans. \"They're happy to have a party with black people drowning,\" Chalian continued, apparently referencing the Republican National Convention. Not surprisingly, he was promptly fired, a source tells Politico. A Yahoo News rep later confirmed: \"David Chalian's statement was inappropriate and does not represent the views of Yahoo,\" reads the statement. \"He has been terminated effective immediately. We have already reached out to the Romney campaign, and we apologize to Mitt Romney, his staff, their supporters, and anyone who was offended.\" Newsbusters was first to make note of Chalian's quote.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma. \n \n Inhofe got his facts partly wrong. The Sandy relief bill initially contained money for projects outside of areas damaged by Sandy, with the hope of attracting enough votes to get it through Congress. \n \n That spending represented a small portion of the massive bill - and much of it eventually was dropped from the legislation after objections by Republicans in the House. \n \n The Sandy relief legislation did not contain money to put roofs on homes in Washington, but there were funds to repair museum roofs damaged by the hurricane. \n \n Oklahoma’s other senator, Tom Coburn, a Republican, wants any federal aid for victims of Monday’s tornado to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, his spokesman said Tuesday. \n \n Democrats, who oppose offsets emergency disaster aid, said Coburn will have to vote against help for his own constituents if he wants to stick to his position. \n \n \"I am gonna go with no offsets,\" said Senate Appropriations Chair Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.)who said lawmakers are starting to assess how much aid Oklahoma will need. \n \n \"Sen Coburn is consistent in his views and he is consistently wrong,” Mikulski said. \n \n Both of Oklahoma’s senators and three of its five House members voted against the $60.2 billion aid package for Sandy victims. \n \n Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), whose district includes the tornado-shattered town of Moore, Okla., voted for the Sandy package. \n \n Rep. Peter King (R-L.I.) who helped move Sandy aid through the House, declined to address Inhofe’s statements but said that he would never deny the state aid because of its elected officials’ opposition to the Sandy aid. \n \n “I don’t want the people of Oklahoma to suffer for something politicians have done,” King said. “I’ve been through this. I will support them 100 percent.” \n \n -With Joseph Straw \n \n dfriedman@nydailynews.com \n \n @dfriedman33 ||||| New York Rep. Peter King on Tuesday said he’s willing to overlook the “hypocrisy” of lawmakers who opposed aid for his state in the wake of Superstorm Sandy but might support funding for tornado-stricken Oklahoma. \n \n “I think there’s a lot of hypocrisy involved here, [Sen. James] Inhofe saying Sandy aid was corrupt but Oklahoma won’t be,” King (R-N.Y.) told POLITICO. “But I don’t want to hold the people of Oklahoma responsible for what elected officials are saying, for the husband and wife without a home, for the people who lost all their worldly possessions.” \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Peter King unloads on John Boehner over Sandy bill Obama: Nation stands with Okla. \n \n King, who stressed that he wasn’t looking for a fight, emphasized that aid should be provided to Oklahoma — which sustained a deadly tornado on Monday — without the requirement of budgetary offsets. \n \n (PHOTOS: Oklahoma tornado) \n \n “I’ve always believed that but certainly, going through it myself [during Sandy], seeing the devastation a national disaster brings to a district…it’s a [national issue], not a local issue, like Sandy wasn’t a New York, New Jersey issue,” he said. “It’s an American issue, we have an obligation to come forward.” \n \n Inhofe (R-Okla.), for his part, said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he had wanted reduced Sandy aid because “everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place” by adding funding for unrelated projects to the measure, but said “that won’t happen in Oklahoma.” Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) indicated early on Tuesday that he would support offsets for Oklahoma aid. \n \n King was a vocal critic of those in his own party who didn’t back full Sandy funding. \n \n “I won’t hold it against anyone,” King said of lawmakers who opposed Sandy aid but could support Oklahoma help without offsets. “I don’t want suffering people in Oklahoma to be held hostage while we engage in political fights, saying ‘I told you so.’ I want to deal with it on the merits.”\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nYou knew this was coming: Peter King, who fought hard for Superstorm Sandy aid for his home state of New York, thinks there's \"a lot of hypocrisy\" when it comes to lawmakers who opposed Sandy aid but are in favor of tornado aid. The subject of his attention most specifically seems to be Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe. King's take is that Inhofe essentially said \"Sandy aid was corrupt but Oklahoma won't be\" yesterday on MSNBC. King is peeved, but tells Politico he'll overlook the perceived dig because \"I don't want suffering people in Oklahoma to be held hostage while we engage in political fights, saying 'I told you so.'\" As for Inhofe's statement, the New York Daily News reports that he \"got his facts partly wrong\" when he said that \"everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place\" post-Sandy by slipping pet projects (like \"putting roofs on houses in Washington, DC\") into the bill. Though the initial Sandy relief bill did include money for areas that were not damaged by the storm, that was just a small portion of the bill and much of that was ultimately dropped. As for Oklahoma's other senator, King thinks aid should be given to Oklahoma without requiring offsets, as Tom Coburn called for.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\na 30-year - old woman was admitted to the department of radiology at ondokuz mayis university hospital due to palpable masses in both breasts . \n we performed bilateral mammograms using the mammo diagnost uc ( philips, hamburg, germany ) conventional mammography unit . \n the ultrasonographic evaluations were performed using a 12 mhz linear array probe on logiq 5 pro ( ge medical systems, milwaukee, wi ) ultrasound equipment . \n the mammograms showed an extremely dense pattern with ill - defined, denser mass - like lesions in upper outer quadrants of both breasts ( fig . \n an ultrasonographic evaluation revealed lobular - shaped and partly ill - defined hypoechoic masses with a 3 - 4 cm maximum diameter and a multi - septated nodular ( mottled ) appearance without acoustic changes ( 3 ) ( fig . \n both axillae indicated pathologically enlarged lymph nodes with skin thickening, increased echo texture in the breast parenchyma, and fine fluid between the fat lobules, which were consistent with edema of the breasts . \n a bone marrow biopsy revealed acute t cell lymphoblastic leukemia . following chemotherapy, the breast lesions disappeared ( fig . \n metastatic breast leukemia is very rare and occurs primarily in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( 4 - 7 ) . \n an ultrasonography is useful in young patients who usually have dense breasts ( 1 ) . \n however, in patients with extreme breast edema, a mammography might not be helpful in representing breast masses . \n hence, in such cases, the ultrasonography would be performed as an alternative modality . \n previous studies suggest that the reduced diagnostic capability of the ultrasonography may be improved by doppler flow mapping, by depicting the hypervascular stroma as highly resistive index values ( 1 ) . \n past studies examining the sonographic features of breast metastases range widely, from hypoechoic to hyperechoic findings ( 1, 4, 8, 9 ) . the involvement of the breasts in cases of acute myeloid leukemia has been described as areas of mixed echogenicity, with or without acoustic shadowing ( 2, 10 ) . \n another study described the microscopic results of breast involvement in an acute leukemia case study of an autopsy series ( 1 ) . in \n most described cases of acute myeloid leukemia involving breasts, the disease appeared bilaterally as multiple nodules ( 3 ) . \n in addition, unilateral breast involvement in a case of acute myeloid leukemia could be seen as a single mass ( 6 ) . \n the mammographic findings in cases of leukemia in the breasts can be normal ( 5, 6 ), enlarged with diffusely coarse breast parenchyma ( 2 ), ill - defined margin with an irregular shaped mass ( 5, 6 ), or well - defined bordered lesions with a benign appearance ( 6 ) . \n the extremely rare involvement of breasts in cases of leukemia can be the only complaint at initial presentation or seen as relapse . \n moreover, radiotherapy performed on breast malignancies can also cause acute leukemia in breast tissue ( 2 ) . following a detailed examination \n, this condition should be added to the series of findings including lung consolidations, pleural effusion, a mass in the mediastinum, or a hepatosplenomegaly which resembles systemic disease . \n our study subject was diagnosed with breast metastases of all, which markedly improved as demonstrated by mammographic and sonographic findings following chemotherapy .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nBreast metastases in cases leukemia are very rare and occur primarily in patients with acute myeloid leukemia . \n we report the involvement of breast metastases in a 30-year - old woman with acute t cell lymphoblastic leukemia . \n the patient 's mammograms revealed an extremely dense pattern with ill - defined, denser mass - like lesions in both breasts . \n a bilateral breast ultrasonographic evaluation revealed lobular - shaped and partly ill - defined hypoechoic masses with a multi - septated nodular ( mottled ) appearance .\n#END SUMMARY"}

These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nA riot at a private Oklahoma prison on Saturday killed four inmates, the second time in three months that violence has erupted at the facility. \n \n The fight at Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, Okla., began Saturday afternoon and lasted for approximately two minutes, according to a statement from Corrections Corp. of America, which operates the facility and is the country’s largest private prison company. It then took prison... ||||| Four inmates died of injuries sustained during an attack or fight over the weekend at an Oklahoma prison, officials said, and investigators are trying to determine what sparked the violence. \n \n File-This March 22, 2005, file photo shows men wait outside the Cimarron Correctional Facility, in Cushing, Okla. Three inmates are dead and five injured after a disturbance at an Oklahoma prison, a spokesman... (Associated Press) \n \n The incident that also left four inmates injured happened around 4 p.m. Saturday at the Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, a community between the state's two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The prison houses medium- and maximum-security male inmates. \n \n Three inmates were declared dead on Saturday and the fourth died overnight at a hospital. Terri Watkins, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said Sunday that preliminary reports show the first three men who died were fatally stabbed. But Watkins said she didn't know the nature of the injuries to any of the other inmates. \n \n The stabbings apparently happened in quick succession while the inmates at a medium-security wing of the prison were being let out of their cells into the exercise yard, Watkins said. \n \n \"The entire stabbing incident happened over a couple of minutes,\" Watkins said, adding that prisoners were all locked in their cells within 40 minutes of the outbreak of violence. \n \n No prison staff were injured or involved in the attack, Watkins said. None of the prisoners' names were released because their families had to be notified first, she said. \n \n One of the treated inmates was later returned to the prison and the other three remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates the prison. \n \n Owen said the inmate attacks lasted less than two minutes. He didn't immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking further details. \n \n It is the second major violent outburst in months at the prison. \n \n In June, some 200 to 300 of the prison's roughly 1,600 inmates were involved in a brawl there. Eleven prisoners were taken to hospitals after the fight and the facility was placed on lockdown. The fighting occurred among inmates in three separate housing units. \n \n Watkins said that as a precaution, all Oklahoma prisons have been placed on lockdown, which means that inmates are confined to their cells and their movement inside the facility is severely restricted. \n \n She said two separate investigations are underway — one by the Department of Corrections' inspector general's office and the other by CCA. \n \n Oklahoma has the highest rate of prison homicides in the nation, with state inmates killed at a rate more than three times the national average, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. \n \n The figures reviewed by The Associated Press as part of a months-long investigation earlier this year show that there were 39 homicides at Oklahoma prisons between 2001 and 2012, a rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates. The national average is 4 per 100,000. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Sean Murphy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| A \"disturbance\" at an Oklahoma prison Saturday afternoon left four inmates dead and several more hospitalized, officials said Sunday. \n \n The brawl, at Cimarron Correctional Facility, started and ended at around 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), officials said. \n \n \"Yesterday's inmate-on-inmate altercation lasted less than two minutes with staff responding very quickly to quell the disturbance,\" the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said in a statement Sunday. \n \n But it took prison staff another 38 minutes to secure the single housing area where the killings took place, officials said. \n \n The facility, which is operated by the Corrections Corporation of America, houses 1,720 medium- and maximum-security male inmates. \n \n The prison was on lock down Sunday while officials investigated, a release said, and three inmates remained in local hospitals in stable condition. \n \n Officials have not released the names of the inmates involved.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA spasm of violence at a private prison in Oklahoma lasted just a couple of minutes, but it killed four inmates and injured several others, officials say. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections describes the Saturday afternoon incident at the Cimarron Correctional Facility as a \"disturbance\" and says staff members in the area responded very quickly, NBC News reports. Officials say the incident, which happened as medium-security inmates were being let out to the exercise yard, left three men dead from stab wounds on Saturday and a fourth man died from his wounds overnight, reports the AP, which notes that up to 300 inmates were involved in a massive brawl at the same facility in June. It's not clear what sparked the violence at the prison operated by Corrections Corporation of America, which the Wall Street Journal notes is America's largest private prison operator. The 1,720-bed facility was locked down after the incident, and officials say that as a precaution, all other prisons in the state are also on lockdown, the AP reports. The AP also notes that with a homicide rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates, compared to an average of 4 per 100,000 nationwide, Oklahoma has the highest prison murder rate in the country.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nTweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ( e.g. de mink et al .\n2013, mathis & remus 2013, song et al .\nmoreover, we will study the complex mhd interactions between the components of binary stars, i.e. : i ) the interactions between stellar wind emitted by each component and the related torques ( * ? ? ?\n* ( e.g. strugarek et al .\n2012 ) ) ; ii ) the magnetospheric interactions and the associated applied torques, helicity exchanges, and modifications of the magnetic activity of the components ( * ?

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nthe endoscopic ultrasound - guided fine - needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) has emerged as a minimally invasive and safe method for material procurement in the differential diagnosis of subepithelial lesions ( sel ) of upper gastrointestinal tract ( ugt ), especially in suspicious lesions of gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) . \n there are few studies discussing the factors that influence the eus - fna in the diagnosis of sel . \n to establish possible associations between lesion size, layer and organ of origin with the outcome of eus - fna in patients with sels of ugt . \n a retrospective analysis using data of patients referred to french - brazilian center of eus of endoscopy department of santa casa de so paulo hospital, with previous endoscopic diagnosis of sel, which underwent eus - fna from may 2006 to august 2011 . \n a total of 222 patients were submitted to eus . 15 with extrinsic compressions and 207 with sel . of these, 89 underwent to eus - fna . \n the eus - fna was positive in 58.7% . in lesions measuring 2 - 3 cm and > 3 cm, the eus - fna was positive in 80% and 72%, respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the size of sels was the only variable that influenced the outcome of eus - fna .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIntroduction : the endoscopic ultrasound - guided fine - needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) has emerged as a minimally invasive and safe method for material procurement in the differential diagnosis of subepithelial lesions ( sel ) of upper gastrointestinal tract ( ugt ), especially in suspicious lesions of gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) . \n there are few studies discussing the factors that influence the eus - fna in the diagnosis of sel.aim:to establish possible associations between lesion size, layer and organ of origin with the outcome of eus - fna in patients with sels of ugt.methods:a retrospective analysis using data of patients referred to french - brazilian center of eus of endoscopy department of santa casa de so paulo hospital, with previous endoscopic diagnosis of sel, which underwent eus - fna from may 2006 to august 2011.results : a total of 222 patients were submitted to eus . 15 with extrinsic compressions and 207 with sel . of these \n, 89 underwent to eus - fna . \n ninety - two sel were diagnosed on eus and punctured . \n the eus - fna was positive in 58.7% . in lesions measuring 2 - 3 \n cm and > 3 cm, the eus - fna was positive in 80% and 72%, respectively ( p < 0.001).conclusion : the size of sels was the only variable that influenced the outcome of eus - fna . \n best results are achieved in lesions larger than 2 cm .\n#END SUMMARY"}

At that time, the boat was some 65 miles (105 kilometers) off Pillar Point, south of San Francisco. \n \n The four might have boarded a life raft, said the Coast Guard, which appealed to the public for help Monday in identifying the missing seafarers. \n \n JUST WATCHED Family: 'We are abandoning ship' Replay More Videos ...

Heather Lampert, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. \n \n Several aircraft and vessels have joined the search. \n \n Asked about the possibility that the report could be a hoax, given that no one has come forward to identify a family as missing, the Coast Guard said that it operates under the assumption that such reports are legitimate. \n \n If the boat did not have a life raft, the chances of survival are slim, said Mario Vittone, a recently retired Coast Guard helicopter rescue swimmer and a marine safety specialist. \"They're not going to live long, even in life jackets,\" he said. \"That's cold water out there.\" \n \n According to the National Oceanographic Data Center, the water temperature off San Francisco was 49.3 degrees Fahrenheit (9.6 C). \n \n Marine accidents in waters below 50 degrees F are five times more likely to end in death, Vittone said. \n \n Computer models will factor in currents, weather and wind to create search patterns to focus searchers' efforts, he said. \n \n The search will continue until the four are found or until the limits of survivability have passed, he said. \n \n Three years later, no sign of missing family ||||| The U.S. Coast Guard was searching Monday for four family members, including two young children, who sent distress calls saying their sailboat was sinking near San Francisco and they were trying to make a life raft out of a cooler and a life preserver. \n \n The group was about 65 miles (104 kilometers) off shore Sunday afternoon when the first distress call came in, Coast Guard Lt. Heather Lampert said. \n \n The boat did not have a working GPS system. The boaters said their sailboat was taking on water and their electronics were failing. \n \n The Coast Guard later lost radio contact. It has received no missing persons' reports. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued an advisory throughout the weekend warning boaters of strong winds and rough seas around the San Francisco Bay Area. \n \n Lampert said Coast Guard crews searched through the night.

The family was in a 29-foot sailboat named Charm Blow when it started taking on water yesterday afternoon about 65 miles off the coast of Pillar Point. One person radioed the Coast Guard and said the electronics on the boat were failing, CNN reports; the AP adds that the vessel did not have a working GPS system. About an hour after the initial call, the occupants—a couple, their 4-year-old child, and a cousin—said they were abandoning ship and the Coast Guard lost radio contact. The family had told the Coast Guard they were attempting to put together a life raft using a cooler and a life preserver. The Coast Guard searched for them through the night, and several other vessels and aircraft have joined to help. A warning had been issued for strong winds and rough seas in the area over the weekend.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Rakoff had dismissed a juror in the legal battle between the British financier Guy Hands and Citigroup after it emerged that the juror had ties to a documentary by Michael Moore, the polemical filmmaker. \n \n Yet in another twist worthy of a John Grisham novel, it turns out that Judge Rakoff dismissed the juror before he got around to asking her about her connection to Mr. Moore’s “Capitalism: A Love Story,” a screed against banks and corporate America. \n \n On Tuesday morning, Citigroup’s lawyers applied to have the juror removed and showed her name listed in the “special thanks” section of the film’s closing credits. \n \n At day’s end, Mr. Rakoff dismissed the jury, but not before urging them to vote by reciting lyrics from the musical “Oklahoma!” (Don’t ask). He then summoned the juror in question — Juror No. 6, Donna Romo-Gianell — into his robing room: \n \n Judge Rakoff: Forgive us for keeping you. I know you need to be on your way too. We had a report that when you were going down the elevator for lunch, you said to three of the other jurors something to the effect of “What could possibly go on this afternoon. When they give us so much information, it is hard to know what to focus on.” Words to that effect. And unfortunately, I’m obligated under the law to inquire about that. Because as you know, we really don’t want anyone talking about the case even in that sort of way to their fellow jurors. So maybe, why don’t you just tell me what happened. Juror No. 6: Number one is I don’t say those kinds of words. That’s not the way I speak. If that happened today, I went by myself. I was one of the first ones out because I just needed to get out and be by myself. So I was not on an elevator with any of the jurors. Judge Rakoff: O.K. Juror No. 6: So it wasn’t me. Judge Rakoff: O.K. So you think it was – Juror No. 6: I don’t know who it was. That’s — that’s not — that’s not the way I speak. And that’s not how I think of things. I — I generate a lot of things, and I let it gel. I’m using the wrong kind of words. What kind of words can I say. But the thing is that I know I needed to get out, get some fresh air, and get out there, and I was not even on the elevator with any other juror. \n \n The judge excused Ms. Romo-Gianell from the room. He then called in the court reporter, who he identified as the person who had come to him “and said, although she was very reluctant, she felt, in light of the colloquy we had had about this juror [regarding her ties to the documentary], that she needed to report something that she had observed.” The court reporter confirmed the judge’s account of the elevator scene and said the other jurors did not respond to Juror No. 6. \n \n Judge Rakoff went on: \n \n I have to say, independently, that my impression of Juror No. 6’s demeanor when she gave the answer she gave in the robing room a few minutes ago was of someone who was lying. Who wanted to make sure that she stayed on this jury rather than admit to anything in the way that might possibly subject her to being excused. I’ve considered the possibility that she was just nervous, but I didn’t sense that at all. I sensed the evasiveness and a rigidness that in the court’s experience is much more consistent with prevarication. And therefore, it seems to me, that given that we have a juror who has lied to the court about an important matter, that we need to excuse her. So I will excuse her. \n \n Closing arguments in the case are set to begin on Wednesday, and the jury should get the case in the afternoon. \n \n – Peter Lattman \n \n Go to Previous DealBook Article »\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA juror found herself bounced from a Citigroup-EMI fraud trial after her connections to liberal filmmaker Michael Moore emerged. Citigroup lawyers played a clip from Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story in court showing juror Donna Gianell’s name in the credits, then asked Judge Jed Rakoff to dismiss her. Rakoff, however, technically dismissed Gianell after he learned she was trying to discuss the case with fellow jurors—a big no-no. Gianell did not appear to be in the film, but was thanked in the credits, the Telegraph reports; the New York Post notes that lawyers claimed her connection to the film proves she is biased against banks. The judge was apparently more upset, however, that when he questioned Gianell about talking to her fellow jurors, she appeared to lie to him, the New York Times reports. The trial centers around British financier Guy Hands’ buyout of music company EMI; he claims Citi tricked him into paying too much.\n#END SUMMARY"}

In a series of seven tweets on Sunday, Obama defended his legacy and the \"remarkable progress\" made during his presidency in areas including job growth and access to affordable health care, CNN reports. \"From realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, we've made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal,\" he tweeted. \"It's been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody.\" There have been 340 tweets from Obama since he got his own account in May 2015, while Donald Trump has posted 34,202 since joining Twitter in 2009. The Guardian reports that the man lined up to be Trump's White House secretary, Sean Spicer, said Sunday that Trump will continue to use Twitter to announce policy and comment on current events after he becomes president later this month. \"You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results,\" said Spicer, who described Trump's use of Twitter as a way to bypass the mainstream media. (On New Year's Eve, Trump taunted his enemies on Twitter.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n AUBURN - Auburn Police are looking for one of their own...a black and white Chevy Tahoe that was stolen around 6:30 pm Sunday night with a police rifle inside. \n \n Commander Mike Hirman told Q13 FOX that someone jumped the fence at the police parking lot on East Main Street and stole the 2012 SUV, smashing through the metal fence and driving off. \n \n Hirman confirmed that there was a loaded police rifle inside the vehicle, but unless the thief knew some secure information, the crook would not be able to access and use the gun. \n \n Hirman said that SUV was last seen heading up Interstate 5 near the I-90 exchange. \n \n Police want the public to be on the lookout for the SUV. It's black and white in color, with Washington license 52815 D, and vehicle number 39 E. If you see it, call Auburn Police, Hirman said. \n \n Hirman said that there are surveillance cameras at the parking lot but they haven't reviewed the video yet. ||||| This is a vehicle similar to the stolen black and white SUV with the Auburn Police Department logo on it. \n \n By Joanna Small \n \n The Auburn Police Department has issued an arrest warrant for a man suspected of hot wiring and stealing a department SUV from a gated parking lot. \n \n Detectives are searching for Suede Shuttle, 21, who they say is last known to have lived in Auburn. If y0u have seen Shuttle, or know where he is, contact the Auburn Police Department's tip line at (253) 288-7403 and refer to APD case 15-16616. If you see him, call 911. \n \n A vigilant construction worker on Mercer Island is responsible for recovering the stolen SUV. \n \n It was found December 28, 2015 after agencies searched all night for the vehicle taken right from the police department's secure lot. \n \n Brad Sessler is used to seeing cars at his construction site up a private drive off West Mercer Way. \n \n Here is a surveillance image of the #Auburn PD patrol car being stolen from lot. @KIRO7Seattle at noon. pic.twitter.com/Fn7HMIlaNi — Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) December 28, 2015 \n \n \"There's usually a bunch of subcontractors,” the project manager told KIRO 7, but not police cars and not from Auburn. \n \n \"I just checked around a little bit and then came down here to the street and called police,” Sessler said after discovering the abandoned police vehicle. \n \n Auburn police are glad he made that phone call. When Sessler showed up for work at 8 a.m. Monday, he inadvertently stumbled upon the vehicle every law enforcement agency in the state was looking for. \n \n Auburn police say a man on a bicycle jumped their fence, got into a marked 2012 Chevy Tahoe patrol vehicle with a caged police issue rifle inside, and smashed through the security gate. \n \n Apparently he picked the right vehicle, as most are locked. \n \n \"Presumably there was probably a key inside the vehicle and he found that,” explained Auburn police Commander Jamie Sidell. \n \n Most aren't nearly as well stocked as this particular vehicle. \n \n Tough to see but stolen patrol SUV is way back by house under construction, far south #MercerIsland. @KIRO7Seattlepic.twitter.com/Msfp1N7inS — Joanna Small (@JoannaKIRO7) December 28, 2015 \n \n \"That's our crash investigation car so it has a lot of investigative equipment in it for reconstructing collision scenes,” said Sidell. \n \n And most don't have a full tank of gas, which got the suspect 30 miles north to Sessler’s work site. \n \n The Tahoe appeared to be intact with all the equipment and the firearm accounted for, but Auburn police still towed it for evidence. They have the bike for evidence as well, because the suspect left that at the scene. \n \n Even though Auburn police said they've never had a cruiser stolen, four years ago, one of their officers had his badge, gun and uniform stolen out of his truck. \n \n That thief was caught.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA suspect in Washington state arrived at the Auburn Police Department's secured city lot on a bicycle Sunday evening and left in a police SUV that had a full tank of gas and a fully loaded rifle inside, KIRO 7 reports. A police commander tells Q13 Fox that the suspect shimmied up and over the fence—which a KIRO 7 reporter notes on Twitter is only about 3 to 4 feet tall—into the lot, then smashed the 2012 Chevy Tahoe right through the lot's locked front gate. Police say there may have been a spare key located somewhere in the vehicle, per KIRO 7. The SUV, which would have been obvious with its Auburn PD logos and police lights, was recovered Monday morning in Mercer Island, the News Tribune reports. It was found on a lot where a home is under construction after a construction worker called it in, per KIRO 7. The police-issued rifle, which had been locked into a cage, was still inside the SUV, as was the pricey gear used for traffic investigations, the station notes. The suspect is still at large.

Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Analyzing breast tissue prone to cancer, Australian scientists found that a protein that fuels pre-cancerous cells also causes osteoporisis—and can be stymied by a common osteoporosis drug. \"It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'Holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk,\" says study co-author Jane Visvader. Published in Nature Medicine, the study looked at breast tissue in mice and three women with a faulty BRCA1 genetic mutation that carries a high risk of aggressive breast cancer, per a press release. When the osteoporosis drug denosumab was applied to the tissue, pre-cancerous cells stopped dividing; when used on BRCA1 mice, two thirds of them developed no tumors, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. For the roughly one in 400 women who carry the mutation, this could be a way around surgery. That wasn't an option for Angelina Jolie, who underwent a double mastectomy and hysterectomy upon learning she had what's now dubbed the \"Jolie Gene.\" But Australian mom Kylie Gellie, who had her breasts, ovaries, and fallopian tubes removed, says her two young daughters may now be able to avoid surgery even if they inherit the gene. \"Maybe they don't have to go through such drastic measures as I did or maybe it can buy them some time,\" she says. A worldwide human trial should be starting within two years. (Meanwhile, double mastectomies are on the rise—among men.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

Initial estimates of the wave's height put it taller than the record set by McNamara in January, which was estimated to be around 100 feet tall. \n \n McNamara holds the certified record for tow-in surfing a wave, also set at Nazare, for riding a 78-foot behemoth in 2011. \n \n Whatever the final, official height of Burle's wave, it was a monster. Burle's ride also happened shortly after he rescued his friend and fellow big wave surfer Maya Gabriel, who nearly drowned trying to catch a wave. \n \n Burle told Surfer Today: \"It was luck. We never know when we will be catching the wave. I still hadn't surfed any wave and everyone had already had their rides. Maya almost died. For me, it was a big adrenaline moment to get back there after what happened.\" \n \n When Anderson Cooper profiled McNamara about his Nazare ride in January, he also talked about surprise and luck when he caught the giant wave. \n \n \"I didn't realize it was that big of a wave until it came down from above and just boom right on my shoulders and it almost squashed me. I almost collapsed,\" said McNamara. \n \n Big wave surfing has a small but dedicated set of adrenaline junkies chasing giant swells all over the world. Several have died in recent years. \n \n When McNamara was interviewed on \"CBS This Morning\" about the sport, he said standing on a mountain of water \"taunting\" the avalanche chasing him is when he is most comfortable. The danger-chasing McNamara said, however, that he won't get on a horse. ||||| | Surfing \n \n Carlos Burle may have ridden the biggest wave of all time, at Praia do Norte, Nazaré, Portugal, during the Big Monday swell. \n \n The Brazilian crew traveled to Portugal with a goal in mind. To beat the Guinness World Record for the largest wave ever surfed, which belongs to the Hawaiian hellman, Garrett McNamara. \n \n Carlos Burle, Pedro Scooby, Felipe Cesarano, and Maya Gabeira had big hopes for the European super swell. \n \n On the 28th October, 2013, Burle claimed one of the biggest wave ever ridden at Praia do Norte. The first pictures show that he may be above the world record set by Garrett McNamara, at 23.77 m (78 feet), measured from trough to crest, on the 1st November 2011. \n \n \"It was luck. We never know when we will be catching the wave. I still hadn't surfed any wave and everyone had already had their rides. Maya almost died. For me, it was a big adrenaline moment to get back there after what happened\", reveals Carlos Burle. \n \n Carlos Burle, 45, from Pernambuco, has been living the adrenaline life of the big wave riders. In 2001, he rode a 22-meter (72 foot) wave, in Mavericks, Northern California. His wave at Praia do Norte will be analyzed by the Guinness World Records.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe huge storm that lashed much of Europe yesterday created some huge waves, including a monster that might earn surfer Carlos Burle a place in the record books. The Brazilian rode a behemoth of a wave at Nazare, on Portugal's central coast, that appears to be even bigger than the 100-foot wave Hawaiian Garrett McNamara rode at the same spot in January, CBS reports. Burle's feat came soon after he rescued fellow Brazilian big-wave surfer Maya Gaberia, who nearly drowned trying to catch a wave. \"It was luck.

On Friday, Nov. 2, the U.S. government issues the... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month and raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade. \n \n The Labor Department's monthly jobs report, the last major economic data before Tuesday's congressional elections, also showed that the unemployment rate remained at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent. \n \n The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009. \n \n Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years and are spending freely and propelling brisk economic growth. The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record, and October marked the 100th straight month of hiring, a record streak. \n \n The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there's no sign of that happening yet. \n \n Still, the latest month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy's performance, that sentiment hasn't necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates. \n \n In October, consumer confidence reached its highest point in 18 years, propelled by optimism about the job market. Last month's plunge in stock prices didn't dampen Americans' enthusiasm, though the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the full market decline had occurred. \n \n In the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years. \n \n Manufacturing output and hiring remain healthy, according to a survey by a private trade association, although increased tariffs have raised factory costs. \n \n By contrast, housing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains. \n \n There are signs that pay growth is picking up. A measure of wage and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the best such showing in a decade. \n \n Although pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy's growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation. \n \n So far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve's preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nThe last unemployment report before the midterms is a strong one. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, above the forecast of 188,000, reports the Wall Street Journal. The unemployment rate itself remained at a five-decade low of 3.7%, per the AP. The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009. What's more, wages rose 3.1% when compared to last October, the best such gain since 2009. It's the first time since the recession ended that wages rose more than 3% over a year. Average hourly earnings in the private sector increased 5 cents to $27.30.\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nThe association was only found among participants who consumed caffeinated coffee, not decaffeinated. Coffee also only appeared to reduce the risk of malignant melanoma, not melanoma in situ, an early form of the disease in which melanoma cells have not spread beyond the outer cells of the skin. This \"may indicate different disease etiologies or an inhibitory role of coffee consumption in disease progression,\" the researchers write. ||||| More than half of all American adults start off their morning with at least one cup of joe. Most drink coffee to wake up and simply get through the day. But new research adds to the evidence that coffee can have significant health benefits -- far beyond helping you make it to that morning meeting. \n \n The latest study finds coffee may lower the risk for the most serious type of skin cancer, malignant melanoma. Prior research has shown coffee may help prevent other types of non-melanoma skin cancers. However, this is the first large-scale study to look specifically at malignant melanoma, which is the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. and the leading cause of skin cancer deaths. \n \n For the study, published Tuesday in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers analyzed data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study on more than 447,000 non-Hispanic whites, who are at higher risk of skin cancer. Study subjects filled out questionnaires about their eating habits, including coffee drinking, and were followed-up after about 10 years. \n \n CDC: Cost of treating skin cancer is soaring \n \n The researchers found that frequent coffee drinkers -- those who consumed four cups or more per day -- had a 20 percent lower risk for developing malignant melanoma than those who drank less coffee. The researchers also observed the protective benefits of coffee increased the more a person drank. Decaffeinated coffee did not provide the same protective benefits. \n \n The authors adjusted for other factors that might influence skin cancer rates, including ultraviolet radiation exposure, body mass index, age, gender, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking history. \n \n While the results of this new study are encouraging for coffee drinkers, the authors say their findings are preliminary, and may not be applicable to other populations. \"Because of its high disease burden, lifestyle modifications with even modest protective effects may have a meaningful impact on melanoma morbidity,\" the researchers conclude. \n \n They called for further research into the impact coffee and caffeine may have on developing melanoma. \n \n Previous studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of other serious conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, depression, liver disease and even early death. The beverage's antioxidant properties have also long been associated with reducing the risk for other types of skin cancer. \n \n One study published in 2012 in the journal Cancer involved 113,000 adults followed for 20-plus years. In that time, 22,800 participants developed basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, which is rarely fatal. The study found that people who drank more than three cups of coffee were 17 percent less likely to develop basal cell carcinoma, compared with those who drank coffee less than once a month.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nHeavy coffee drinkers who worry about their habit can at least bear this in mind: They have a lower risk of getting skin cancer, according to a large-scale study. Researchers found that people who downed four cups a day have a 20% lower risk of developing malignant melanoma, which CBS News notes is the fifth most common cause of cancer in the US and the deadliest form of skin cancer. The study crunched data from 447,000 adults who were tracked over 10 years. The more coffee they drank, the less likely they were to develop melanoma. The scientists from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the Yale School of Public Health emphasize that this \"modest\" decrease in risk obviously doesn't mean coffee drinkers can skip the sunblock, reports the LA Times. The study shows only a link, not a cause-and-effect, and researchers can't say for sure what's going on. But the findings generally didn't apply to decaf drinkers, so one theory is that caffeine plays some role in the protection, reports LiveScience. (Those who find coffee bitter might try it in a white mug.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nin patients with obstructive colorectal cancer, where conventional colonoscopy can not traverse obstruction, clearance of the proximal colon remains a problem . \n a 58-year - old woman presented to her physician with rectal bleeding and intermittent diarrhea . conventional colonoscopy revealed a bulky tumor which was diagnosed as rectal cancer . \n slim optical colonoscopy ( pcf - p240al / i, olympus, tokyo, japan ) showed obstructive cancer in the rectosigmoid junction ( fig . 1, arrow a ) and no information of the proximal side of the obstruction . \n the patient then underwent multidetector - row computed tomographic ( ct ) colonography ( virtual colonoscopy ) for further evaluation of the proximal colon . \n three - dimensional endoluminal  fly - through images revealed another protruded lesion ( fig . \n diagnosis of synchronous double cancer was made by ct air - contrast enema image ( fig . \n this ct data was not only used to create three - dimensional images but also to decide on a preoperative clinical staging . \n laparoscopy - assisted high anterior resection was performed and t3 rectal cancer and t1 sigmoid colon cancer were confirmed in the resected specimen ( fig . \n between 4.6 and 11% of patients with colorectal cancer have a second synchronous cancer [ 1, 2, 3 ] . \n preoperative evaluation of the whole colon and rectum in patients with colorectal cancer is widely recommended . \n optical colonoscopy is the current gold standard method as it examines the whole colon and rectum . \n however, preoperative examination by optical colonoscopy may be hampered by occlusive colorectal cancer, and failure to find the presence of a synchronous cancer will change the surgical approach from circumscribed resection to resection of the involved segments . \n ct colonography might be offered in preference to barium enema for incomplete colonoscopy [ 5, 6 ] . \n ct colonography has recently become a popular preoperative examination tool with significant improvement in quality of image due to a rapid progress in computer technology [ 7, 8 ] . \n ct colonography correctly showed synchronous double cancer in our case and provided crucial information for planning surgery . \n we recommend that ct colonography should be used for evaluating the proximal side of obstructive colorectal cancer, as it is well tolerated and less invasive [ 6, 9 ] .\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nA 58-year - old woman presented to her physician with rectal bleeding and intermittent diarrhea . optical colonoscopy revealed a bulky tumor which was diagnosed as rectal cancer . \n she was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment . \n slim optical colonoscopy showed an obstructive cancer in the rectosigmoid junction and no information of the proximal side of the obstruction . \n the patient then underwent computed tomographic ( ct ) colonography for further evaluation of the proximal side . \n three - dimensional endoluminal  fly - through images revealed another protruded lesion in the proximal side of the obstruction . \n diagnosis of synchronous double cancer was made by ct colonography . \n this ct data was not only used to create three - dimensional images but also to decide on a preoperative clinical staging . \n laparoscopy - assisted high anterior resection was performed and t3 rectal cancer and t1 sigmoid colon cancer were confirmed in the resected specimen . \n follow - up optical colonoscopy revealed no other tumors . \n ct colonography has recently become a popular preoperative examination tool with significant improvement in quality of image due to a rapid progress in computer technology . \n ct colonography correctly showed synchronous double cancer in our case and provided crucial information for planning surgery . \n we recommend that ct colonography should be used for evaluating the proximal side of obstructive colorectal cancer .\n#END SUMMARY"}

Crawls of supported \"No More 404\" sites. ||||| The crazy roller coaster, which is my career in dating, took a rather exciting turn last month, when I was head-hunted by Time Out Group to spearhead their increasing involvement in the world of dating. \n \n One of my first jobs in my new role was to work with the magazine's global editorial team, to create a worldwide dating survey and then analyse all the answers we got back. Over 11,000 people worldwide responded to the Time Out Global Dating Survey. You can check out all the big headlines here, but for me, it was the random facts which made me chuckle as I compared the way people in different cities date. \n \n 1. We All Think We're Hotter Than Our Dates \n \n Time Out asked survey respondents to rate both themselves and their average dates, out of 10. The international readers were incredibly self-assured. Rather than punching above their weight, on average daters scored themselves as 7.3 out of 10, and their dates just 6.5 out of 10. But if everyone is dating someone less attractive than him or herself ... \n \n 2. Hong Kong Men are the Biggest Players \n \n One of the questions on the survey was about how many people respondents dated at once. Even in cities like New York and London, where apps like Tinder have made it increasingly easy to get a date, people answered relatively conservatively. The average in most cities was under 3, with one stand-out exception. The average man in Hong Kong, according to the survey results, dates up to 4 women at a time. \n \n 3. Three is the Magic Number \n \n As long as I can remember, there's been a mythical rule about third dates and sex. The survey results didn't really dispel that rumour - the global average is 3.53, which obviously considers more conservative cultures too. However for me, the interesting number '3' was in the comments by a Chinese man who answered the survey. 'Marriage is talked about on date number three' he explained, matter of factly. \n \n 4. LA Men are the Most Needy \n \n The survey asked respondents how soon you need to become exclusive to just one partner. The global answer was an average of 6 dates, however in LA the results were noticeably different between men and women. Whilst LA women will wait to almost the 8th date for exclusivity, LA men desire it after just 4 dates. Does that mean it's a city full of disappointed men? \n \n 5. London Women are Easier than New Yorkers \n \n I don't know about you, but when it comes to sex, I've always assumed New York women were more liberal than Londoners. Yes, it's an impression predominantly created by the character Samantha in Sex in the City, and her regular sex marathons, but I certainly assumed reality mirrored fiction. Not so - according to the survey results, New York women wait a whole extra date to broach the subject of sex in their city than Londoners do (Date 4.61 vs 3.57). \n \n What do you think? Do the results speak for your city? Let me know what you think below. \n \n To see the results in full, go to timeout.com/dating-2015/ \n \n Illustrations by Ryan Chapman and Time Out Digital Ltd. \n \n Follow Charly Lester on Twitter: www.twitter.com/30dates\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nFor single people around the world, it seems that date No. 4 is the one most likely to end up in the bedroom for the first time. A TimeOut survey asked 11,000 people in 24 cities, \"After how many dates is it appropriate to have sex?\" and came up with an average answer of 3.53. Some other highlights: Best city for dating: Paris (with a score of 83 out of 100), Melbourne (81), Kuala Lumpur (74), Beijing (59), and Chicago (58). Elsewhere in the US, New York finished seventh (52) and LA ninth (50). Most attractive accent: British (27%), American (8.7%), Irish (8.1%), Australian (8%), and French (7.7%). Unhappiest daters: New Yorkers are No. 1 here, with 45% describing themselves as \"sad to be single.\" Best way to meet: Websites or apps are tops at 60%. (Paris was the lone city where \"going out/parties\" trumped online dating sites.) At the Huffington Post, Charly Lester, who helped create the survey, writes that one of her favorite facts from it is that daters rated themselves an average 7.3 out of 10 and their dates a 6.5. \"But if everyone is dating someone less attractive than him or herself ...\" She also was struck that women in London are \"easier\" than their counterparts in New York—they bring up sex after an average of 3.57 dates, vs. 4.61 for the Americans.

It starts by explaining the concept using a wire with current flowing from bottom to top, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. The presenter uses the right-hand rule to explain the direction of the magnetic field, which is represented by concentric circles around the wire.\n\nThe video then introduces a second wire with current flowing in the opposite direction, demonstrating that the magnetic field also travels in the opposite direction. The presenter then combines the two wires into a single flat circular coil, explaining how the magnetic fields interact and form a single magnetic field running through the center of the coil.\n\nThe video progresses to discuss solenoids, which are created by adding more turns to the coil. The presenter explains that the magnetic field within a solenoid is strong and uniform, and outside the coil, the field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The video then introduces the concept of electromagnets, which are essentially solenoids that can be turned on and off by controlling the current flow.\n\nThe presenter concludes by discussing ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet. These include increasing the current flowing through the solenoid, increasing the number of turns in the coil, decreasing the length of the coil, and adding an iron core to the solenoid.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nAdd a location to your Tweets \n \n When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Now, the 22-year-old Olympic runner is about to fulfill her dream. \n \n Akinosun tweeted this almost exactly five years ago, and now it's all happening. \n \n Akinosun told BuzzFeed News that she sent out the prophetic tweet in 2011 shortly after watching the televised World Championships for track and field. \n \n \"Watching it may have inspired me to tweet that,\" Akinosun told BuzzFeed News. \n \n Akinosun, who attended Waubonsie Valley High School in Illinois, said it was the summer before her senior year and she was about a month into the recruiting process for college track and field at the time she sent the tweet. She hadn't yet chosen to attend the University of Texas, from which she will graduate in December. Akinosun spent her first year at University of Illinois, but transferred to Texas to follow her coach Tonja Buford-Bailey after she took a job there in 2013. \n \n \"At the time I tweeted that out, it was more of a dream and an aspiration,\" Akinosun said. \"A goal has to be somewhat realistic,\" she added, explaining that in 2011, \"I wasn't on the level yet and I didn't know for sure that I would ever get there, but I for sure wanted to get there.\" \n \n Now, she's only a week away from flying to Rio de Janeiro to compete in the 4x100-meter relay for the 2016 Olympics. \n \n \"When I crossed the finish line in Eugene a few weeks ago,\" Akinosun said, referring to Oregon-based Olympic trials that qualified her for Rio, \"it was sort of like disbelief ... and then I realized I was really going to the Olympics and I started crying.\" ||||| Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) \n \n Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) \n \n Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) \n \n Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) \n \n By finishing fourth in the Olympic Trials 100m, Morolake Akinosun made her first Olympic team and made her tweet from 2011 a reality. \n \n Akinosun tweeted on July 28, 2011, that in 2016 she would graduate from a school she had not yet chosen (University of Texas) and be going to the Olympics. \n \n Akinosun, after finishing her college career this spring, was not among the most heralded sprinters going into the Olympic Trials, with a top time of 11.07 seconds for 2016. \n \n It would require somewhere around 11.00 seconds to make the Olympic 4x100m relay team by finishing in the top six at the Trials on July 3. \n \n Akinosun shined at Trials, breaking 11 seconds for the first time in her first-round heat, then doing it again in the semifinals and the final (10.95 seconds). \n \n Akinosun is now slated to race in the Olympic 4x100m relay first round on Aug. 18, and if she performs well, perhaps earn a place on the relay final quartet one day later. \n \n MORE: U.S. long jumper pulls out of Olympics \n \n In 2016 I will be 22, graduated from a school I have not chosen yet, and going to the olympics (: — Morolake Akinosun™ (@MsFastTwitch) July 28, 2011\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nIn the summer of 2011, a 17-year-old heading into her senior year at an Illinois high school started thinking more seriously about her future, and she determinedly announced her plans via social media. \"In 2016 I will be 22, graduated from a school I have not chosen yet, and going to the Olympics,\" Morolake Akinosun tweeted—a post that turned out to be more prophetic than she could have ever imagined. \"At the time I tweeted that out, it was more of a dream and an aspiration,\" the now-22-year-old tells BuzzFeed, just a week before she hops on a plane to Rio to dash down the track for the 4x100-meter relay race in the 2016 Games (her first-round sprint will take place on Aug. 18, per NBC Sports). After she left Waubonsie Valley High School, Akinosun spent some time studying at the University of Illinois before transferring to the University of Texas, which is where she'll accept her diploma from in December. She headed to the Olympic qualifying trials in Eugene, Ore., earlier this summer and shocked even herself with the success that's now sending her to Brazil. \"When I crossed the finish line … it was sort of like disbelief … and then I realized I was really going to the Olympics and I started crying,\" she says. The funny thing is, Akinosun had completely forgotten about her tweet into the online ether until it popped up recently on her Timehop app. She tweeted a pinch on the arm to herself Saturday: \"I tweeted that 5 years ago. It's 2016. I graduate from Texas in December. I'm going to the Olympics next week.\" (Who won't be competing: all of Russia's weightlifters.)\n#END SUMMARY"}

It was first released in 2009 and gained popularity when Edward Snowden used it to expose the government's mass surveillance programs.\n\nThe speaker explains that most personal computers track users' movements and collect biometric data for advertising purposes. Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

About 150 supply bundles, vehicles, communications equipment and indirect weapons systems were dropped, according to Army spokesman Maj. Juan Martinez. But three Humvees slipped from their rigging as their parachutes deployed. plummeting hundreds of feet to the earth. Martinez said no one was hurt. \n \n \"The specific malfunctions that occurred on this day are under investigation,\" Martinez said in an email to Army Times. \"There were multiple rehearsals and inspections of the equipment prior to mission execution.

After finishing a shift, he would stay awake until the following evening and then sleep until it was time to go to work again. \n \n He often consumed an energy drink containing caffeine and had experienced vomiting several times in the year prior to his death, a symptom of caffeine intoxication. \n \n On the day he died, he was sleeping after returning home and later vomited. He was sent to the hospital but died. It is uncertain what quantity of energy drinks he had consumed. \n \n Shinichi Kubo, a professor of forensic medicine at the university, concluded that the man had died from a caffeine overdose and reported the results to the police after carrying out an examination. \n \n While no other illness or abnormality was recognized, a small amount of alcohol was found in the man’s blood and a high concentration of caffeine was contained in his gastric residuals, blood and urine. \n \n As there were no signs of foul play a legal autopsy could not be performed. \n \n As a result, the university was unable to run an extensive study on part of a pill, apparently a caffeine tablet, found in his stomach and discover how it contributed to the man’s death. ||||| Pedestrians wait to cross an intersection in Shibuya, Tokyo. Getty Images \n \n A Japanese man in his 20s may have been the first in Japan to die from caffeine poisoning. \n \n The man, whose name wasn't released, lived in the Kyushu region in western Japan and died in the fall of 2014, according to Dr. Shinichi Kubo, a professor of forensics at Fukuoka University. The police had asked Dr. Kubo to determine the cause of death. \n \n Dr. Kubo said during a news conference Monday that the man, who worked overnight at a gasoline station, frequently consumed energy drinks at work and was said to have displayed symptoms of excessive caffeine consumption at least a year before he died, Dr. Kubo said. \n \n The autopsy also showed high a concentration of caffeine in the man’s stomach, including in powder and granular forms, indicating he might have been taking caffeine tablets as well, Dr. Kubo said. \n \n There have been no reports of death due to caffeine in records dating back 10 years, according to an official at the health ministry’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Safety Bureau. \n \n Death from too much caffeine would likely require consuming 140 8-ounce cups of coffee in one day, according to some experts. \n \n The Japanese government hasn’t put forward any advice on excessive caffeine intake. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says 600 milligrams of caffeine, or about four to seven cups of coffee, per day is too much. Cases of death from caffeine overdose, including a student who died after taking caffeine tablets to stay awake, have been reported in the U.S.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nWhen an unidentified man in his 20s in Kyushu, Japan, died suddenly and inexplicably in the fall of 2014, police ordered an inquest into the cause of his death. Now Dr. Shinichi Kubo, a professor of forensics at Fukuoka University, is announcing that it appears to be the country's first documented case of fatal daily caffeine consumption, reports Japan Times. \"We had never heard of fatal caffeine intoxication,\" the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry said. The man, who worked midnight to dawn at a 24-hour gasoline station, had vomited on multiple counts in the year leading up to his death; Japan Times reports such vomiting can signal caffeine intoxication. The actual quantity of caffeine he consumed on the day of his death and in general is unknown. He was found to have trace amounts of alcohol and a high concentration of caffeine in his stomach (in a granular form that suggested he might have taken tablets), blood, and urine, as well as the remnants of a pill that may have also contained caffeine. Fukuoka University determined the drinks—reportedly mostly soft drinks—were most likely what killed him, though the school wasn't legally permitted to run extensive tests on the pill. Some experts put the lethal amount of caffeine ingestion in a day at 140 8-ounce cups of coffee (containing 14,000mg), reports the Wall Street Journal, though the FDA tells Americans that 600mg (so roughly 6 cups) is too much. There have been reports of fatal caffeine overdoses in the US; this high school prom king died of a caffeine overdose just before graduating in 2014.\n#END SUMMARY"}

Tails OS, however, is a Debian-based Linux distro that boots from a USB stick, turning any computer into a temporarily secure machine. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes the feature of \"Amnesia\" in Tails OS, which ensures that everything done on the operating system disappears automatically when it shuts down. This is because Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the computer's memory. \n\nThe speaker also mentions that Tails OS includes privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which conceals the user's location, IP address, and usage. Any application that tries to access the internet without the Tor network is automatically blocked on Tails.\n\nThe video then provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run Tails OS from a USB stick. The speaker stresses the importance of having a good connection to the Tor network for the best privacy and security.\n\nKey takeaways from the video include the importance of privacy and security in today's digital age, the benefits of using Tails OS, and how to install and use it. The speaker also emphasizes that everything done on Tails OS is stored in random access memory and not on disk, adding an extra layer of security.\n#END SUMMARY\nRelevant Transcript:\nLibya: confusion surrounds 'capture' of Gaddafi's son Reports that one of Col Gaddafi's sons Mutassim has been captured in Sirte have been cast into doubt. \n \n Advertisement ||||| By Rania El Gamal and Tim Gaynor \n \n SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Fighters loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fought a last-ditch battle in an ever shrinking pocket of resistance in the ousted leader's hometown Sirte on Thursday. \n \n National Transitional Council (NTC) commanders moved up tanks to fire at buildings from close range to try to dislodge the remaining Gaddafi snipers who are now surrounded on all sides in one small part of the city. \n \n \"We have control of the whole of the city except neighborhood 'Number Two' where the Gaddafi forces are surrounded,\" said Khaled Alteir, a field commander in Sirte. \n \n \"This operation is on its dying breath,\" said another commander, Colonel Mohammad Aghfeer. \n \n The siege of Sirte, which began after the capital Tripoli fell to the NTC two months ago, has held up Libya's transition to normality as the country's new leaders say they will only start building a democratic system after the city is captured. \n \n Efforts to extinguish resistance in Sirte received a big boost on Wednesday when, NTC officials said, government forces captured Gaddafi's son Mo'tassim, a former national security adviser, as he tried to escape the battle-torn city. \n \n \"He was arrested today in Sirte,\" the head of the Tripoli Revolutionary Council, Colonel Abdullah Naker, told Reuters.\n#END TRANSCRIPT\nRelevant Summary:\nForces fighting for Libya's new regime say they are on the verge of taking Sirte, Moammar Gadhafi's hometown and one of just two Libyan cities still held by pro-Gadhafi fighters. But a spokesman for the National Transitional Council says that contrary to earlier reports, there has been no confirmation that Gadhafi's son Motassim has been captured in Sirte, although some fighters close to Motassim have been seized. Celebratory gunfire and fireworks lit up the skies over Tripoli and Benghazi following early reports that Motassim, Gadhafi's fourth son and a former military commander, had been captured, Reuters reports. Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, Libya's de facto leader, told the Telegraph that the NTC expects to declare final victory over Gadhafi's forces within a week, clearing the way for elections next year. \"Within less than a month we will form a transitional government and the youth and women will have a role in that,\" he said.\n#END SUMMARY"}
